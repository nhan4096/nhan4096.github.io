                    <span class="bold">Description:</span>
                    <span>SCP-9160 collectively refers to literary works, usually short stories approximately less than one-thousand words, possessing common characteristics; individual instances are to be referred to using an identification number, e.g. SCP-9160-1. It is of note that all instances of SCP-9160 come from one common source, henceforth referred as SCP-9160-A. SCP-9160 instances are characterized by:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The presence of first-person narration, if only to provide greater emotional impact to the reader;</li>
                        <li>The presence of aversive, shocking or disgusting content (e.g. blood, violence and murder), with the sole purpose of also causing greater emotional impact to the reader;</li>
                        <li>An over-detailed storytelling narrative (i.e. including extraneous details) despite the fact that these details are never readdressed further in the story;</li>
                        <li>The absence of a cohesive story, usually as a direct result of the above characteristic;</li>
                        <li>The presence of a moral, frequently without a deep connection to the story, often to also provide greater emotional impact to the reader;</li>
                        <li>The complete lack of emotional impact, negative or positive, induced on the reader, despite the first two characteristics and the fifth suggesting otherwise. Readers also report that the stories lack meaning and are written to cause distress in those perceiving SCP-9160, although it is apparent that such goal is achieved without much efficacy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>A notable effect of SCP-9160 is the amnesia-inducing nature of the instances; readers also report that the story is "unmemorable" and "easily forgotten".</span>

                    <span>Sample SCP-9160 Instances</span>
                    <p>The following is an instance of SCP-9160, SCP-9160-36, subsequently removed by Foundation webcrawlers upon their discoveries.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>It has been 10 days since I got diagnosed with Tri-N. My life is much, much worse now that I've been diagnosed, and I don't think I'll recover anytime soon.</p>
                        <p>Tri-N makes everyone who has it increasingly sadder and sadder. Those with the disease are completely hopeless, because there are no treatments or vaccines for the disease. Ever since I got diagnosed with Tri-N, my life has been going south. Dopamine breaks down and reacts with the sodium, in salt, and without dopamine, my body hasn't felt happy since. It breaks down into sodium hydroxide, a base. My nose also constantly bleeds for no reason.</p>
                        <p>I live with my roommate (Ben Sanders) and he has grown increasingly concerned with my emotions. He keeps saying I "should open up", but I'm afraid of other people judging me.</p>
                        <p>In reality, Ben is really good at human psychology. He is also excellent at medicine. He drew my blood for a blood test and said that I have blood type CB. He says, "People who have this blood type are more likely to feel sad than people who don't".</p>
                        <p>I've decided that my illness is nothing to hide. In short, you shouldn't hide your weaknesses in fear of other people's view of you, and you should just... always be yourself!</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Below is instance SCP-9160-3.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>"CB, run, LCK has lost his mind."</p>
                        <p>This chilling letter could've been sent to me, but thankfully I was on vacation. Apparently, from what I've heard, my friend LCK had gotten "brainwashed" and then lost his mind.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with me, LCK had shared that he was tired. Tired of being abused, only as a homework helper. Tired of being isolated. Tired of being... truthfully, he told me, tired of being alive. From that moment on, I knew that LCK's head was messed up one way or another, and sooner or later, he would snap.</p>
                        <p>That day came.</p>
                        <p>First was my friend Andy. Andy was always a nice guy, to me, but he kept calling LCK names. He was targeted first, with a knife stabbed into one of his veins. Thankfully, we had rescued him in time, and he survived with injuries while staying in the hospital for a while.</p>
                        <p>Second was my friend Annie. I thought they had always been friends, but not now apparently. LCK chased Annie across the school hallways until Annie was so tired she collapsed. Well, yet another victim down.</p>
                        <p>Third was the P.E. teacher. Maybe LCK really hated him, but he suffered the most injuries. According to my friends, he bled out a lot, like a lot. Didn't die, unlike what LCK would've wanted.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, my roommate, Idibiks was lucky enough to find a hiding spot. He hid underneath the bed and thankfully LCK didn't find him.</p>
                        <p>Now, LCK is sitting behind bars... The moral of the story is, don't... judge others!</p>

                    <span>Reactions to SCP-9160</span>
                    <p>Compiled below are two interviews conducted by Dr. Phillips to D-36167, the latter being instructed to read SCP-9160-36 and SCP-9160-3. It is of note that the second interview occurred one day following the first.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p class="italic">&lt;begin transcript&gt;</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Good morning. Please read this piece of paper.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Phillips slides a sheet of paper to D-36167 with the contents of SCP-9160-36 inscribed.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> What is this?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Test subjects may not speak at any time unless instructed otherwise. It is a short story. Please read it.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167 <span class="italic">[under his breath]</span>:</span> Rude.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The recording is silent for the next thirty seconds while D-36167 is reading the paper.</p>
                        <p class="italic">D-36167 looks up at Dr. Phillips, gesturing that he has finished reading.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> You may now speak.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> I'm done reading... whatever that was. What now?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Tell me how that story made you feel.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Uh... nothing? I remember the details, but they don't constitute a story. If it was a story, there wasn't much meaning to it.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Continue.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> There was a moral that didn't fit in with the rest of the story very much. There was blood mentioned, but I feel nothing about that part. And, I think I'm supposed to empathize with the narrator, but their misfortunes didn't have much impact on me.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Can you retell the story in your words please?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Um... something about Tri-N?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Further than that.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> ...I have forgotten everything about that story other than the fact that there was no impact from it.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Do you remember what happened yesterday?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> I think you forced me to read something for one of your tests.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Can you remember exactly what?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Uh... no, but it was a really badly written story.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Interesting. Can you read this for me now, please?</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Phillips slides a paper to D-36167 with the contents of SCP-9160-3 inscribed.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> You may talk when you finish reading.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Didn't say that to me before.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Keep reading.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The recording is silent for twenty seconds when D-36167 finishes reading. He gestures to Dr. Phillips that he is done.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> I assume you want me to do what I did yesterday. It... certainly was a story! In my honest opinion, it reads like how I imagine an angsty and edgy writer would write to emulate criminal horror.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> You may continue.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Again, zero emotional impact, moral doesn't really make sense since it feels like putting duct tape over a gaping hole, I don't empathize nor care for anyone involved even though good writing should. Wait, what was that character who snapped called again?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> I have not read it.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Whatever, what matters is that the killer just feels generic. There is no characterization here.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Now, retell the story in your own words.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-36167:</span> Uh... killer snaps, kills a bunch of people, narrator survives due to some deus ex machina because why not. That's what I remember.</p>

                                        <li>What is "CBD Inc."? What is the purpose of your company, what does it produce, and what does the company do?</li>
                                        <li>Are you aware of the stories being produced and posted on websites? Why do these websites have obviously wrong expiry dates, and how did you acquire a .gov domain?</li>
                                        <li>Who is writing these stories? Are these from your writers? If they are, we would like to contact them as well.</li>
                                        <li>Do you have a motive for writing these stories? Are they for the enjoyment of the reader or something else?</li>

                    <p>From previous WHOIS lookups, it can be seen that GOI-9160 is located in the United Kingdom. For investigative purposes, a geolocation of GOI-9160 is needed.</p>
                    <p>A report is attached below.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Per this analysis, it is likely that GOI-9160 is located in London, United Kingdom as all locations, including omitted ones, are all present within the locus.</p>
                        <p>Foundation researchers and analysts were able to locate buildings with possible ties to GOI-9160.</p>
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p class="bold">The CBD Dispensary</p>
                            <p>Relevant due to namesake; however, it is a recreational drug store. It is for this reason that this building is not related to GOI-9160.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Storywriters' HQ</p>
                            <p>Relevant due to the nature of SCP-9160 and GOI-9160's work; however, known works produced and published by the building were high-rated and nonanomalous, two attributes contradicting the theory that the building is related to GOI-9160.</p>
                            <p class="bold">CBII&mdash;CBD Corporate Office</p>
                            <p>Relevant due to the namesake and the purpose of the building; however, the two companies in the name have declared bankruptcy and thus the building should not exist as a corporate office. Per Foundation personnel stationed in London, the building does not exist.</p>
                            <p class="bold">CBD Storywriting Office</p>
                            <p>Due to the nature of the building's purpose and its namesake, it has been determined that this building is the most likely to be GOI-9160. The relevant building is to be referred to as SCP-9160-B.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>An investigative mission to the relevant office is pending.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Dr. Harry R. Phillips has been chosen as the first operative to explore SCP-9160-B due to his knowledge of the anomaly and the proximity of his home to the building (seventy-five meters), however, the exploration is to be limited in its range. Further and more in-depth exploration is to be performed by Mobile Task Force Sigma-9160 ("Anti-Writers").</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Dr. Phillips reporting here, currently outside of 9160-B. Entering.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The building is in a state of disrepair. He enters through the double cracked glass doors.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> I'm sure I'll get a notice for trespassing because of that. Well, hope the bigger guys up there can defend me.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The door leads straight to what seems like a reception area. There is a large marble and circular table. Behind it is where the receptionist would stand.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Looks to be a reception area.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Phillips drags his finger on the table. Dust sticks onto it. He puts his finger near his eyes and looks at it.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Quite dusty...</p>
                        <p class="italic">There is a singular door to the right, which Dr. Phillips walks through.</p>
                        <p class="italic">An ill-lit hallway appears. On both sides of the hallway are doors, spaced approximately five meters from each other. Dr. Phillips walks slower in the hallway.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> This is creeping me out...</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Unknown <span class="italic">[in a muffled voice]</span>:</span> Is anybody there?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Phillips:</span> Fuck that, I'm chickening out of here!</p>
                        <p class="italic">He runs back to the front door, exiting the building in a hurry. The recording cuts.</p>

                    <p>Following Dr. Phillips' withdrawal from the building, the MTF Sigma-9160 was dispatched one day later; below is the transcript of the mission.</p>

                        <p class="italic">The four enter SCP-9160-B. The description given by Dr. Phillips matches that of the footage.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Continue ahead to that hallway.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-3:</span> Jesus, it's really dark in here. Permission to turn on headlights?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Affirmative.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They turn on their headlights then move forward to the long hallway where Dr. Phillips had terminated the exploration previously.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Unknown <span class="italic">[in a muffled voice]</span>:</span> Hello? Is anybody there?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1 <span class="italic">[yelling]</span>:</span> Please, we don't want to cause any harm.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Is it from that door?</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-2 points at the door immediately next to him on the left.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Unknown <span class="italic">[in a muffled voice]</span>:</span> Come in, please.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The unknown voice opens the door. It is revealed to be a disheveled man wearing ripped clothing, appearing not to have practiced hygiene for an extended period of time.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-3 <span class="italic">[under his breath]</span>:</span> God.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-4:</span> Shush!</p>
                        <p class="italic">The room that the man was in contains one wooden chair and table. A laptop sits on the table, currently opening Notepad. The room is dark as the agents' headlights and the laptop are the only source of light in the room. There are cobwebs in the corners of the room. Further instances are to be referred to as SCP-9160-B and then an identification number.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-1:</span> They trap me in here and all they say is to write stories all day long. My colleague is nextdoors. I don't know how long this hallway even is. Where are we?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> London. CBD Incorporated. Does that ring a bell?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-1:</span> ...No. Where is London? God, that makes me sound stupid doesn't it? Forgive me as I'd be surprised if I could remember when the last time they allowed me to go outside was. Or the last time I actually saw someone, instead of writing them in these stupid stories.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-3 <span class="italic">[under his breath]</span>:</span> What a&mdash;</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-4:</span> Shush, damn it!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Do you have anyone here with you?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-1:</span> There's my colleague next door. There's my second colleague next door to that. There's my third colleague next door to that. I don't know how many of us are in here, and all I know is that I must write these stories for someone to post.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Again, CBD Incorporated. Does that ring a bell?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-1:</span> I can faintly remember it, but I couldn't tell you who my employer is.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Uh, should we get you people out of here?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-1:</span> Don't bother. KPI is a fucking nightmare, you know?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> We'll see you later. Can we move to the next door over?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Copy that.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four move towards the next door over. Sigma-9160-1 knocks on the door.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-2:</span> Who's there?</p>
                        <p class="italic">He opens the door. SCP-9160-B-2 appears identical to SCP-9160-B-1. His room is in a state of decay similar to that of SCP-9160-B-1; the layout is also identical.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Why do you look so similar to your colleague?</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-2:</span> They, to be frank, suck.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9160-B-2:</span> You know, when you lock all your writers up in this prison, force them to work for twenty-four hours straight with no breaks, who would've thought that the stories they write would suck? Their formula according to some ISO 9001 standard also sucks. They keep maximizing this buzzword that is "emotional impact", so much so that the stories become meaningless. Its meaning is literally reduced to "maximized emotional impact". Who would've guessed that that would suck? No one, obviously.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Can I call you by something?</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Copy that.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four move back to the mentioned door. They knock, but no voice calls out this time.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-1 grabs the handle. It falls off. He then pushes the door, and it falls off the hinges. It gives way to a staircase. There is a partially see-through door. Beyond it is a large clutter of chairs. The area within this door is much more well-lit than the remaining hallways for no apparent reason.</p>

                        <p class="italic">The four walk down the staircase. Sigma-9160-4 hesitates, but eventually also walks with the rest of the group. Sigma-9160-1 leans on the door to rest while waiting for Sigma-9160-4 to come down, expecting it to stand. The door breaks cleanly off of its hinges. Sigma-9160-1 tumbles down the rest of the staircase.</p>

                        <p class="italic">SCP-9160-B-3 walks towards the operatives. He looks identical to the previous instances.</p>

                        <p class="italic">The group walks up the staircase while SCP-9160-B-3 gestures to them.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Opposite of SCP-9160-B-2's cell. Come on, folks.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> Copy that.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They walk through the hallway to the cell on the left side of the hallway and on the second door. When they are in the immediate vicinity of the door, the floor gives way and opens a large chasm in the ground. All four members of the group fall in, albeit without major injuries.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-3:</span> Shit!</p>
                        <p class="italic">It reveals a previously concealed server room. Per ultrasound technology, the Foundation was able to estimate the area of this server room to be 5.5km2. The servers are placed in neat blocks, whereas the wiring is vine-like and spreads through the room in a convoluted way.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Where are we?!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-4:</span> A server room, it looks to be.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> I think that's the first time in the entire mission you've talked. You must be very concerned then.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-4:</span> What, did you miss me or something? I'm still here, sir.</p>
                        <p class="italic">There is a five-second period of silence on the recording; nothing is heard except for the humming of the server room.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> It sure is hot in here.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-1 places his hand on one of the servers. He instinctively takes it off immediately due to the high temperature of the machinery.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Ow!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> That was stupid to do.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Astute observation, sir.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four then wander around in the server room, being cautious not to physically contact any of the servers.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-3:</span> How... big is this?!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> The hallway is nine kilometers long for comparison. Who knows?</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-2 trips and falls due to the unevenness of the heavily wired ground.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He stands up.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-4:</span> There's a server block here that's exposed, come look!</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-4 gestures to the rest of the group about a server block with cracked glass casing. The group moves to Sigma-9160-4's position.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> That can't be good.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four observe it closely. The humming of the server room continues as the four are in silence.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> What sort of company builds this kind of tech? For terrible stories?!</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> That sounds like the Foundation.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-1 reaches his hand to touch one of the wires. Sigma-9160-2, in reaction to the action, slaps the former's hand. The commotion causes the wire to break.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Loud screaming is heard from all nine kilometers of the hallway above. It ceases after five seconds.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> ...What the fuck did you just do?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-2:</span> What the fuck did <span class="italic">we</span> just do?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Should we check the hallway rooms or what? Climb back out, people.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four in succession each climb back on the panel of wood which detached from the hallway. They walk towards the closest room, that being the room directly opposite from where they were standing. It is SCP-9160-B-2's room.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The door is still open.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The four stand in silence as they peer into the room, without SCP-9160-B-2 in sight.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> I&mdash;I'm sure that the other rooms aren't like this.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They walk, also in silence, towards SCP-9160-B-1's room. The door to it is still open. No one is present in the room.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Sigma-9160-1 runs towards the room directly across from where he was originally standing. He descends the stairwell in a hurry.</p>
                        <p class="italic">There is no voice.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Sigma-9160-1:</span> Command, command, we request to exit the anomaly since we just fuc&mdash; did something to the anomaly.</p>

                    <span>Additional Information Regarding GOI-9160</span>
                    <p>Dr. Phillips has continued his investigation into GOI-9160. The following is his compilation of facts gathered per his research.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The company had declared bankruptcy in 2003.</li>
                        <li>There were, at its peak, twenty employees dedicated to writing at the time the company was not bankrupt.</li>
                        <li>According to official schematics, the supposed hallway has a length of ten meters, significantly shorter than what was seen in the video. The server room was also on the ground floor and not beneath it. There was also no receptionist desk; the reasons for why the building must be retrofitted with it is unknown.</li>
                        <li>There were no SCP-9160 instances found before 2003.</li>
                        <li>There were no SCP-9160-B instances documented before 2003.</li>
                        <li>The building was turned to ruin after the company declared bankruptcy.</li>
                        <li>SCP-9160-B subinstances are believed to be manifestations of past writers for GOI-9160 existing only by the technology existing in the server room; as such, they were killed following Incident 9160.1.</li>
