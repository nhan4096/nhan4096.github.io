        <h1>Welcome to A Bootleg SCP Collection! Now also known as Intelization for various reasons.</h1>
        <p>As it says on the tin. These are SCPs that I wrote, for your enjoyment.</p>

                    A few precautions: The SCP numbers do not correspond to actual SCP entries on the SCPWiki. The SCP entries will be obviously subpar to those on the SCPWiki, as I'm not an experienced writer. Finally, these SCPs are completely unaffiliated with the SCPWiki, as I am underage and cannot post there.

                    <blockquote class="quote">Do we need to divert a major part of our budget towards this? I do not think humanity is ending anytime soon &mdash; sure, all of us are mute now, but that isn't fatal.</blockquote>
                    <p>Author's note: Recommended for starters; heavy philosophical content.</p>
                </div>

                    <blockquote class="quote">There was a very rude man at the intersection today. He yelled at me for "not seeing the red light". It wasn't very clear to me at first, since the red light was dimly lit.</blockquote>
                    <p>Author's note: Recommended for starters; definitely more emotional. Slightly weaker than my previous work.</p>

                    <p>Author's note: Also slightly weaker than my previous works.</p>

                    <p>Author's note: My weakest SCP yet, as it was heavily rushed. Not proud of this one. Avoid.</p>

                    <p>Author's note: My best work so far. Be warned as it is significantly longer than any of my other pieces, clocking in at approximately 10000 words. For this reason and also for its content, probably not recommended for first-time reading.</p>

                    <p>Author's note: Recommended for starters. Second-best work by me, maybe? Surprisingly short (~4000 words), but very emotional.</p>
