                    <p>SCP-9030-A's life and the archives regarding him have been falsified to continue the secrecy of the Veil. Should discoveries in spite of the misinformation supplied by the Foundation about SCP-9030-A be made, standard academic misinformation practices are to be performed and its authors discredited. The physical diary of SCP-9030-A is to be kept in a standard secure locker for inanimate items.</p>

                        <p>Hans Parker is a talented scientist, most known for his works and advancements on our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum. He was born on March 5th, 1986, in the small town of Lennoxtown, Scotland. Since his early childhood, he had an immense interest in light and the mechanics of it. Graduating from the University of Glasgow near his hometown, he quickly became a renowned physicist. Then, as his thesis, he began to work, owing part to his deep enthusiasm to the topic, on the topic of light. During one of his experiments, he had discovered a strange realization: light, radio waves and X-rays are all manifestations of the same phenomenon!</p>

                    <p>Attached below are the diary entries of SCP-9030-A, arranged chronologically. It is assumed that SCP-9030 is a condition worsening with time, thus the chronological order of the diary entries may provide additional information on the progression of SCP-9030. His diary entries were first suspected by the Foundation due to esoteric and possibly anomalous theories about his death; they were promptly seized for investigation.</p>

                        <p>Today was not an interesting day. As far as I can remember, there was nothing too memorable.</p>

                        <p>Dear diary,</p>
                        <p>There was a very rude man at the intersection today. He yelled at me for "not seeing the red light". It wasn't very clear to me at first, since the red light was dimly lit. I guess it's technically partly my fault, but I don't think he should've been that serious about it. Well, traffic regulations are supposed to be strict.</p>
                        <p>I'm trying my best not to stew over it.</p>

                        <p>Dear diary,</p>
                        <p>There's a prism I got as a gift from my friends. Today, when I woke up, I noticed that the sunlight from the window was beautifully yellow. I'll try to develop a photo to attach to this notebook. The sunlight from the window diffracted in the prism, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. The indigo and the violet today were also especially strong, and also, as beautiful as that yellow, though.</p>
                        <p>It seems that this was a good sign! The day ahead was great because I had spoken at a university about my discoveries. I'm heading to bed happy tonight!</p>

                        <p>Today I had a peculiar conversation. The other person was making small talk with me in a queue, which I don't like but also don't mind too much.</p>
                        <p>"Today's a sunny day, yeah?" I asked them. "What? It has been particularly cloudy lately." I replied, "Huh?" Looking confusedly at the weather, they said "...Yeah. Pretty sure it's very cloudy."</p>
                        <p>I open my phone to see the weather app. Cloudy 21°C, it said.</p>
                        <p>Guess it's time to buy more prisms!</p>

                        <p>Do you know that tint childhood puts on our vision? That yellowish tint which made everything so, so much more vivid. My eyes may have been de-aging somehow, because everything is so colorful now. I... must honestly say that I prefer it this way. It reminds me of back then, when I was so young and so interested in light. Now I'm a leading scientist at the theory of light in physics.</p>

                        <p>Dear diary,</p>
                        <p>The light in my bedroom has been humming really loudly for some reason. Nobody has noticed this except for me. I called the electrician over, and he didn't find any issues, nor did he hear the humming. I still paid for a replacement light though.</p>
                        <p>Maybe the prism worked. This time because I had accidentally ordered a blue light for my bedroom, instead of a cozy yellow one. They had, luckily, shipped a yellow one instead! I'll try to see if any humming continues.</p>

                        <p>It seems, upon a rereading of my diary, that I've been describing a lot of things about my vision receiving light weirdly. Maybe it's just a placebo. Maybe it's not because I'm a physicist literally trained to detect these kinds of changes...</p>

                        <p>Remember what I had said about "my vision returning to childhood colors"? Well, it seems that that's getting really apparent. The lights in my bedroom, I do not think that they have ever been nicer. The lights outside in the living room and other rooms are also yellowed out.</p>

                        <p>Green and a bit of cyan have completely died out. Blue is now red. I can not think of the last time I saw something blue to give as an example for my rapidly deteriorating vision.</p>

                        <p>Blue is dead. Purple is red. Out of the seven colors on the prism, I am able to see one.</p>

                        <p>I hope that my handwriting is still legible because I am now completely blind. I can only see my notebook through the sunlight reflecting purplish colors, thus making me see the negative space, where the notebook isn't. There is nothing I would give up to be able to see you again, light.</p>

                        <p>I can't see you anymore. I know you're still there, you've supported me for so long. You made my career and my childhood interest and who I would become. You've led the way for me, figuratively and literally for my entire life, up until now. You're still there, beautiful and elegant as the first day I've seen you.</p>
                        <p>Good night, l[ILLEGIBLE]</p>

                    <p>No further entries were found in the notebook. On 19/03/2023, Dr. Haines' body was found in his apartment. No lights were on by the time authorities were able to enter his flat.</p>
