                    <span>SCP-9016 is a LNK-Class Linguistic Collapse scenario, happening shortly following the phrase "Câm mồm!" being uttered by a closely related anomalous entity, further referred to as SCP-9016-A. Sounds produced by biologically produced vibrations which are intentional (e.g. speech, grunting or singing) of all species which have them are, succeeding the manifestation of SCP-9016, completely incapable to be vocalized. Attempts at vocalization only result in failure; as the vibration of the vocal flaps only result in a frequency of ~0.006736Hz, significantly below animal hearing levels.</span>

                    <span>Interview with SCP-9016-A</span>
                    <p>After a series of geolocation attempts, Foundation researchers were able to triangulate SCP-9016-A's coordinates to a singular building in ███████████ ████. The following is a transcript of a digital conversation (due to the circumstances presented by the ongoing SCP-9016 crisis) held between Dr. Mintay and SCP-9016-A.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p class="italic">&lt;begin transcript&gt;</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Hello. Please state your designation</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> SCP-9016-A. I do not think that your christened name will last very long, though.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Let us begin the interview. Why did you say that phrase?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> Both of us know. You and the rest of your species come here, on my planet to infiltrate and to trouble me with your cowardly mouths. I loathe and seethe over the sound — sorry, noise of your kind. Order must be given, and it is only given by me, to you.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Interesting... Expand, please?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> Not just your kind, but also what your planet surrounds itself with. Those pestlike birds haunt your ears, but why do you not notice? Those bothersome <span class="italic">animals</span>.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Why are we and the animals, apparently, bothersome?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> Your mouths and whatever else make nothing but noise. Sound, meaningful sound only reveals itself from objects you say are "noise". The fans in plane engines or those in your home, the air conditioning unit that rattles at just the right amount, the fridge humming and buzzing or that light, right there in this room, the light I can hear clearly and I enamor it. You yourself are noise. Then there are the animals. If they had complex thought, and this extends to you, they would've silenced themselves long ago.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Where does your power come from?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> It was given to me since I have existed. I was not born, but I seem to have only manifested in a sudden burst. I did not have my own volition then, but I am more than content with how I can make you bestow silence and reticence to me at will now.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> I firmly ask you not to try and "reverse" my efforts. I am trying to help you to protect you from yourselves.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> Please, I must go.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Dr. Mintay:</span> Thank you for your time.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">SCP-9016-A:</span> Benevolence is not needed for theological deities, I believe, doctor.</p>

                    <span>Transmissions Received By Foundation Radio Towers</span>
                    <p>Exactly one day (twenty-four hours) after the conclusion of the interview with SCP-9016-A, the following transmission was received in rich text formatting (thus allowing for formatting choices, such as font changes or italics). It has been decoded for convenience.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>MESSAGE TO THE FOUNDATION. F=6.736MHZ<sup class="footnote"></sup></p>
                        <p class="garamond italic">Then, He came and said "Let there be no more noise", and no more noise there was.</p>
                        <p class="garamond italic">Then, one full day and one full night passed.</p>
                        <p class="garamond italic">Then, such a blasphemous organization, the Foundation came and said "Let there be chaos" and chaos there will never be.</p>
                        <p>We are the Order of the Silent, and we have seen your efforts of reversing what once was, a reactionary of some kind. We firmly request that humanity be kept in reticence.</p>
                        <p>Please, let us communicate thoroughly via this frequency.</p>
                        <p class="italic">&mdash; Order of the Silent</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The following response (also decoded for convenience), was sent by the Foundation on the same frequency. It was transmitted one minute and forty-seven seconds after the previous message was sent.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>Please, inform us about your interests and why you think this way. We identify as the Foundation and believe that humanity's speech is essential to who and how humanity is.</p>
                        <p class="italic">&mdash; SCP Foundation. Secure. Contain. Protect.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>For the brevity of the document, the message immediately below was sent by the group identifying themselves as "Order of the Silent", further referred to as GOI-9016; the next messages are in an alternating chain between the Foundation and GOI-9016. Any important remarks by the Foundation are to be made before the message block.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>To repeat what was said previously, we strongly believe that humanity was impure before the Silencing. Now that the Silencing has happened, humanity is reduced to complete purity: we were never meant to be creatures that made, only to receive. We were meant to be creatures to receive what He has said; He, an omnipotent and all knowing deity.</p>
                        <p>Let us think. Why do we make? Is it to fulfill some selfish interest? We also firmly believe this is true; us humans should not be able to make anything, if the only purpose of this action is to achieve what our own ego has told us. Creation is the rot of humanity. None of us are destined for creation, all of us are destined as servants to Him, of great power.</p>
                        <p>When He ordered silence to us, we bestowed silence back to Him. If He had this power, He is to be considered as a true deity, a deity to follow. If He had caused the Silencing, why should we not continue this way? Why would it not be disrespectful to Him? What tribulations could he make us go through if we do not follow? He is at utmost and endmost power; we, humanity, in one ordered collective dare not to challenge Him.</p>
                        <p>We respect your efforts to reverse the Silencing, but we regard the Silencing to be an event never to be dismantled. Humanity is now <span class="italic">pure</span>.</p>
                        <p class="italic">&mdash; Order of the Silent</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>We do not understand why you consider humanity in this manner. We were meant to be creatures that made, we <span class="italic">were not</span> meant to be creatures that only spinelessly, absentmindedly received what your supposed "deity" (known in our documents as SCP-9016-A; we would prefer it if you referred to it in this way) or whoever else says.</p>
                        <p>As such, the Silencing (known in our documents as SCP-9016; please also refer to this event this way) is an event to be reversed. Speech is essential for humanity, for what we made, for how we talked to each other and, even more selflessly, for how <span class="italic">everything</span> communicated. From the birds outside our facilities singing to the least cherished of creatures, cockroaches hissing, they are all equally important. If this "impurity" of humanity was such a selfish act, should the preservation of the muteness of <span class="italic">all other animals</span> not be considered as selfish as well?</p>
                        <p class="italic">&mdash; SCP Foundation. Secure. Contain. Protect.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>Both Him and the Silencing are to be admired. To disrespect Him is to disrespect an entity, who we do not know how much power the entity possesses. To disrespect Him is akin to disrespecting the mother of the planet, the mother of the universe itself. To disrespect the Silencing is to disrespect what He had made. To disrespect the Silencing is to disrespect what He had made, to protect us from ourselves, from our own rot of creation itself.</p>
                        <p>Let us redefine the rot of creation. The rot that is creation is a selfish act, punishable as a sin. He has power to both help us, seen through the Silencing arriving and to force us to endure endless tribulations, through this rot of creation. If we do not follow him, humanity will be rotten with the act of creation. We do not know why He had to protect us from this rot, but we only know that it is rot. We do not know what will happen to us if we do not listen to Him.</p>
                        <p>We are not creators. We are recoils and derivatives of Him.</p>
                        <p class="italic">&mdash; Order of the Silent</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p>What evidence do you have that creation is something to be left behind, as a form of "rot"? The act of creation is not inherently selfish, unlike what you say. We create not only for the enjoyment of ourselves (which is what we presume to be the “selfish” part of creation, according to you) but also for what others can receive from it. We create for others and not just ourselves, and it is for this reason that creation is <span class="italic">not</span> selfish.</p>
                        <p>If creation were to be selfish, why should inventors like Thomas Edison not be berated for their inventions? Why did they create the inventions? The point of creating a lightbulb is not for Edison's enjoyment, but for the advancement of the knowledge of humanity and for the convenience of the entirety of humanity.</p>
                        <p>Next, you mention SCP-9016-A in the same light as a deity, but we would like to rectify that this is not true. You allude to humanity being silenced after SCP-9016-A yelled that phrase as evidence for its power, but you can not prove that SCP-9016-A is truly powerful. It is completely possible that the only power of SCP-9016-A is to silence humanity completely and nothing else. You can not conclude that it is an "omnipotent and all knowing deity" since it did this one anomalous act.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, you refer to the “tribulations” we will go through if we do not follow the alleged deity. We believe that absentmindedly consuming knowledge as prescribed by SCP-9016-A is actively harmful towards humanity, much more so than genuinely and actively producing content. During the ten thousand years we existed as a civilization, there were no visible tribulations that this supposed deity would make us go through. During the golden age of Greece, of India, of Europe, or the Industrial Revolutions where inventions were being created in rapid succession, were any of us punished for this supposed "sin"?</p>
                        <p>We think that your rhetoric is actively harmful towards the advancement of humanity, and as an organization primarily focused on the protection of humanity, we can not and will never accept your ideology. Your rhetoric is nothing but suppositions without fact or evidence. To repeat what was said, SCP-9016 and SCP-9016-A are to be reversed and destroyed, and this eon be remembered as a dark time for humanity, not to be cherished nor be nostalgic about.</p>

                    <p>Following the final transmission by GOI-9016, an emergency O5 meeting held digitally was held to discuss a conceivable course of action and the morality of speech (as this was an important point repeatedly raised within the transmissions).</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> Alright. As a summary, we have been receiving communications from a group self-identifying as the "Order of the Silent". I'm sure all of you have read these?</p>
                        <p class="italic">All the remaining O5 members react to the message, confirming the statement.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> We can see that this group is most likely a cult that holds some amount of power. Luckily, I do not see any records of this cult propagating its influence to the extensive world. I would like to suggest that we continue communication with the group to ensure that their influence does not spread, additionally we also attempt to persuade them.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-3:</span> That seems fair. I do not think that our persuasion will work, but when push comes to shove...</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> Let us do what we do best &mdash; have a vote.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> Now, for the more difficult decision. How should we reverse the effects of SCP-9016?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-3:</span> There doesn't seem to be anything viable other than scientific research.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> How about funding?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> We're the Foundation, remember. We have more than enough budget for this.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> Hmm... how urgent is this? Do we need to divert a major part of our budget towards this? I do not think humanity is ending anytime soon — sure, all of us are mute now, but that isn't fatal.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-4:</span> One thing which is very concerning is how widespread the impact is. It's not just humanity, it's the entirety of biological life which can produce sound.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> ...I've just realized something. Birds, as an example, use mating calls. Since SCP-9016 affects this, birds may be at risk of extinction. We have a ticking time bomb that will explode in ecological <span class="italic">catastrophe</span> if we do not resolve this soon.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> Therefore, I suggest that we divert a significant part of our budget to resolving the issue.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-4:</span> Let us think further about this issue before we act. Can we not breed birds artificially?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> Technically so, but the efficacy of that would be minimal. The ecological impact will still exist even if we breed them artificially.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-4:</span> If there is a silver lining to this approach, at least birds will not become extinct if the natural population of them dies out.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> There is nothing explicitly ensuring that the birds will survive in captivity.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-1:</span> So our course of action is split between two options: fund research as much as possible and hope that the effect gets reversed before the ecological wreckage happens, or we attempt to prevent the ecological wreckage via funding.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> How about both?</p>

                        <br><br>
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>Let us address your points.</p>
                            <p>Firstly, you say that creation is not selfish because "creating is both for the enjoyment of ourselves and for what others will be able to receive from it". We would like to elucidate that this is not individually selfish, as both us and whoever consumes our creative piece receives meaning, but it is collectively selfish: that humanity, as a collective, creating is a selfish act. We only ever create for ourselves: think about how many inventions there were that were only created for our own enjoyment. From the currently nonexistent and esoteric "cure for cancer", pet food (we only ever keep pets for our own enjoyment &mdash; if they did not release chemicals that made our brains "happy", we would not keep them), or so-called inventions "to save the environment" are only because we live in that environment &mdash; again, if the environment being destroyed did not affect us, we would be completely apathetic towards this issue. To address your point about Thomas Edison: it has also been discussed indirectly. Again, Thomas Edison was not selfish individually, but he was selfish collectively.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, we would like to shine light on the hypocrisy that your organization brought upon itself. You "rectify" that He is not a deity, but your proof is only a mere emotional argument and a supposition: "What if [His] only power was being able to silence humanity by using a phrase?" For an organization which claims to protect humanity, you do not take enough steps to ensure extreme cases. We are able to flip the question on its head, namely "What if [His] only power was not just being able to silence humanity by using a phrase?" If this were true, the implications would be catastrophic, and again, we think that you do not take enough measures to ensure the survival of humanity.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, you say that there were no "tribulations due to humanity committing this sin, being the act of creation". This is major ignorance on your behalf, as the effects are immediately visible when the issue is thought over completely. When the Industrial Revolution was brought about, it gave us steam engines. And it was the catalyst for us releasing a significant amount of greenhouse gasses, thus accelerating climate change and wreaking havoc on ourselves. When the Golden Age of India was ongoing, it brought us math and trigonometry and astronomy. Then, we used those advancements, in an act of selfishness, collective selfishness may we add, to send satellites and spaceships and rockets out to space. This contributed to both climate change and "space trash". If we did not create, would all of this not happen?</p>
                            <p class="garamond italic">Then, He said “Let there be reticence”. And reticence there was. There was no more noise, no more chaos, no more self-sabotage from the subordinate-to-Him humans. Humans were so perfect and pure. Then, a sacrilegious organization, in a fit of vandalism, the Foundation tried to reverse His work.</p>

                                        <p>Dear O5 Council,</p>
                                        <p>I would like to start this message by stating that speech is moral. The remaining contents of this email is to give reasoning as to why.</p>
                                        <p>Firstly, speech is what defines us, and it is one of the core attributes that makes us, us. All of our advancements had to be made from some sort of communication, from person to person. The knowledge of this advancement must be known in some regard, which is why oral speech is such an effective manner in this regard. Since the advent of humanity, which I would like to argue is the period where humanity was "purest" (i.e. our nature was most discernible at this stage), we have been implicitly and explicitly communicating with each other; linguistic theories give us reasons to what we could have been vocalizing at the start, but, herein this debate on the morality of speech, we do not need to give an explicit answer to what we were saying initially. Without speech, we would not be ourselves.</p>
                                        <p>Next, there is no manner in which speech can be viewed as immoral which is also logical. Repeating the previous point, speech is a crucial part of us and saying that speech is immoral would be to call ourselves immoral. Note that we can not call ourselves, as a collective, immoral as it is categorically impossible: we can not label a species immoral as, at that point, we are not describing anything meaningful. Any train of thought which considers speech immoral is simply absurd.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, the relevant event not only affects humanity but also, much broader, almost all animals. To say that speech is immoral is also to say that other animals are "immoral" for possessing speech as well. Similar reasoning can be used from the second argument to explain why animals speaking can not be considered immoral.</p>
                                        <p>Moreover, although it is not related to the reasoning of the morality of speech, I would like to suggest that we terminate contact with GOI-9016. It seems that the points that GOI-9016 have been making recently are being repeated and no amount of persuasion by us will change their mind. Continuation of conversation with them seems like a waste of time if they continue to be stubborn like what we have seen so far.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">O5-2:</span> I must agree. The most recent transmission from them has been largely repeating the same arguments and bringing nothing more to the table. I do not think that any amount of persuasion will actually change their mind.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">O5-3:</span> After all, they probably are a cult. A cult will never change its mind.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">O5-6:</span> I really do not think they will change anytime soon. They will continue to be stubborn, hardheaded and very opinionated preachers.</p>

                    <span>Research on the Reversal of SCP-9016</span>
                    <p>Attached is the paper regarding the research of the reversal of SCP-9016.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p class="bold">I. Identifying the cause of SCP-9016</p>
                        <div class="left-indent">
                            <p>So far, within this investigation, we have linked SCP-9016-A's incantation as a direct cause to SCP-9016. We still have not answered why SCP-9016-A's power exists. Let us run appropriate tests to identify the type of power that SCP-9016-A possesses.</p>
                            <p class="bold">i. These two variables are not causal but only correlated</p>
                            <p>We have identified that this is not true as there are no other possible causes of SCP-9016-A other than SCP-9016-A.</p>
                            <p class="bold">ii. SCP-9016 was caused by SCP-9016-A modifying the physiology of vocal cords within a past timeline</p>
                            <p>Per anomalously modified atomic clocks 1&mdash;137 currently running at Site-19, there were no disruptions to reality at any time which affected vocal cords. Note that the atomic clocks have been running since T+0.15s after the Big Bang.</p>
                            <p class="bold">iii. SCP-9016-A is a reality bender</p>
                            <p>After a Hume test of SCP-9016-A was performed, levels were detected to be significantly lower than baseline reality levels. Therefore, this conclusion has been determined to be true.</p>
                            <p class="bold">iv. SCP-9016-A is a Class O-Ontological reality bender</p>
                            <p>No ontological shifts were detected at the time of SCP-9016.</p>
                            <p class="bold">v. SCP-9016-A is a Class P-Physical reality bender</p>
                            <p>Effects of SCP-9016-A were propagated in an outward manner, where the vocal cords of individuals affected had changed physically. Therefore, this conclusion has been determined likely to be true.</p>
                            <p class="bold">vi. SCP-9016-A is a theological deity</p>
                            <p>An Akiva radiation test was performed on SCP-9016-A; levels were found to be significantly higher than baseline. Therefore, this conclusion has been determined to be true.</p>
                            <p class="bold">vii. Final conclusion</p>
                            <p>SCP-9016-A is a Class P-Physical reality bender and theological deity. The power of SCP-9016-A was derived from these attributes, thus causing SCP-9016 when the incantation was spoken aloud.</p>

                        <p class="bold">II. Possible solutions</p>
                        <div class="left-indent">
                            <p>We suggest possible solutions with their respective advantages and limitations. It is of notice due to the nature of the incident, it may recur without prior indication.</p>
                            <p class="bold">i. Manual individual physical reconfiguration of vocal cords</p>
                            <p>Solution entails the surgery (or other physical method) of reconfiguring vocal cords.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Most plausible and possibly requiring the least research out of other solutions;</li>
                                <li>Able to be distributed worldwide easily via the training of surgeons on the surgery.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="bold">Limitations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exorbitantly costly both money-wise and time-wise approach, will have to be distributed to more than eight billion humans and more significantly, numerous affected nonhuman species;</li>
                                <li>Does not prevent the incident from recurring;</li>
                                <li>Does not provide any changes if the incident recurs, must be redone should the SCP-9016 recur;</li>
                                <li>May not work as SCP-9016-A is a theological deity, as such, vocal cords may be affected in a non-physical manner.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="bold">ii. Temporal reversal of affected timeline</p>
                            <p>Solution entails the reversal of the affected timeline and supplanting baseline reality with an unaffected timeline, without the existence of SCP-9016-A and SCP-9016.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Prevents the incident from recurring as SCP-9016-A does not exist;</li>
                                <li>The effect is immediately worldwide, hence, the solution is extensive.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="bold">Limitations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Research may take too long and consume too much monetarily;</li>
                                <li>Solution may be impossible if SCP-9016-A is omnipresent and thus not able to be eradicated completely; this is plausible as SCP-9016-A has been proven to be a religious deity.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="bold">iii. Deicide of SCP-9016-A</p>
                            <p>Solution entails the deicide of SCP-9016-A.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Prevents the incident from recurring as SCP-9016-A does not exist;</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="bold">Limitations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Solution may be impossible as SCP-9016-A has been proven to be a religious deity, thus it may be omnipresent and immortal;</li>
                                <li>Solution does not ensure that SCP-9016 will be reversed, only ensuring that SCP-9016 will not recur;</li>
                                <li>Does not resolve SCP-9016 immediately, should it be resolved via the solution.</li>
                            </ul>
