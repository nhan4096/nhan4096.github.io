Civilians and other unauthorized personnel are to be denied entry to SCP-9116, citing trespassing as the reason why. Following the interview detailed in Addendum 9116.1, Foundation guards are to be present at the building and be rotated every thirty days.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> SCP-9116 is a two-chambered concrete building located in Oymyakon, Russia. The design of SCP-9116 contains two rooms connected by a narrow viewport made of clear plexiglass. The second chamber can not be entered through any non-destructive means, and the door is located in the first chamber.</p>
                    <p>The contents of the second chamber can not be ascertained through traditional means, but one D-class subject, D-5469, has been instructed to research the building and recount his experience through an interview (see Addeendum 9116.1).</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Addendum 9116.1:</span> Interview</p>
                    <p>The following is a transcript of an interview conducted by Dr. Annie Nguyen and the interviewed subject D-5469, who had been instructed to look through the viewport of SCP-9116.</p>
                    <div class="left-accent text-block">
                        <p><span class="bold">Interviewer:</span> Dr. Annie Nguyen</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Interviewed:</span> D-5469</p>
                        <p class="italic">&lt;begin transcript&gt;</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> Good morning. So, could you tell me about what you had seen in the second chamber?</p>
                        <p class="italic">D-5469 begins tapping his fingers against the table. He hesitates before speaking.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> ...could I not?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> No, but you may still take your time.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues tapping his fingers against the table, and occasionally pinches the bridge of his nose. He pauses for a prolonged amount of time.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> Do you remember what home is?</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Annie Nguyen appears quite surprised at the question. She chuckles briefly before answering.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> Well, quite fondly so. Why do you ask?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> How do you feel about your family?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> I love them very much. They've always been who I could trust and be vulnerable around.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> There's this sort of... humanity and love to them, isn't there? I feel like what lies beyond that chamber is like that. But without the taste of home. It's empty and frantic, soulless and heartless, it feels insincere. Like someone was trying to emulate what home felt like.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> Interesting. Could you elaborate further?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> It's alien. One moment it gave me vivid visions of my mom scolding me for getting low scores, and another it gave me the smell of a cigarette being lit. An&mdash;and alcohol.</p>
                        <p class="italic">D-5469 pauses. Nguyen nods and gestures to D-5469 to continue.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> God damn it. I can still remember their looks. Their fucking looks. How th&mdash;they'd stare at me, like they were focusing on something a mile away so as to not look at me. Their eyes were like daggers and the smoldering heat of a thousand flames. Stabbed me in the&mdash;in the heart.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> I&mdash;I can smell the damned boiling sulfur-y eggs from here. My family was... you know, poor and struggling. I don't like the eggs. They told me to be grateful that I had a roof over my head and that I had food to eat. They took me outside once just to make me look at the homeless people just to inspire some sense of wretched gratitude. I can hear the scream as she yells in my mouth to shove the damned things in my mouth, chew and then swallow. I mean, I guessed I still survived.</p>
                        <p class="italic">D-5469 appears to be distressed, until he finally puts his face in his palms and starts to cry.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> It&mdash;it's okay you know, don't force yourself to talk. We can end the interview now.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> No&mdash;no, it's okay.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nguyen:</span> I really don't think it is. You can stop.</p>
                        <p class="italic">D-5469's cries slowly turn into hysterical sobbing before he regains his composure.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">D-5469:</span> I've learnt that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.</p>
                        <p class="italic">&lt;end transcript&gt;</p>
