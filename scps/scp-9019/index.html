                    <span>Containment of SCP-9019 is significantly more difficult due to the extent that SCP-9019 has been integrated into baseline society. No personnel with a Cognitive Resistance Value lower than the 75th percentile are to be assigned to SCP-9019-related duties.</span>
                    <p>SCP-9019 instances, if found, are to be contained at Provisional Site-9019 for further testing.</p>

                    <span class="bold">Description:</span>
                    <span>SCP-9019 is an extant species within the same genus as ordinary humans, <span class="italic">Homo offendii</span>. Its characteristics superficially resemble that of humans, however, they possess completely different morphologies and physiology. Individual SCP-9019 instances are to be referred with an identification number, e.g. SCP-9019-1. SCP-9019 instances verbalize in human language, albeit with lesser precision. The vocalizations of such are significantly more inflammatory than those of baselines with radicalist and extremist subtexts, causing laughter and overall joy<sup class="footnote"></sup> in other SCP-9019 instances. A common denominator between these vocalizations is that they are supposedly "dark humor" (i.e. humorous, or attempts at humorous, statements involving sensitive topics, such as sex, gender or racism). However, such jokes almost invariably fail throughout the normal human population, commonly being reported as unfunny. Attached in Addendum 9019.1 is a collection of compiled vocalizations.</span>
                    <p>SCP-9019 instances propagate throughout humanity via species interchange &mdash; nonanomalous humans are, through a poorly understood process, converted into SCP-9019 instances. It has been noted that the inflammatory vocalizations and statements of SCP-9019 are known to be linked to this species interchange process; prolonged exposure to such are proportional to the likelihood of being converted into SCP-9019 instances. It is also of note that the minority of individuals who find such statements "funny" are virtually always converted; with 100% of the cohort doing so. Exactly none of the general populace who are not part of the previously mentioned cohort have been observed to undergo the species interchange process.</p>

                    <span>Compiled Vocalizations by SCP-9019 Instances</span>
                    <p>The following is a compiled list of SCP-9019 instances' vocalizations.</p>

                    <p>The joke was said aloud by SCP-9019-2344. No laughter was caused despite the presence of other SCP-9019 instances. It is also of note that SCP-9019-2344 possesses a slightly-above average mental aptitude test, compared to that of SCP-9019 instances (an average score on the SCP-9019 mental aptitude test corresponds to a significantly below average score on the standard human mental aptitude test).</p>

                    <p>The list was said aloud and in staccato. SCP-9019 instances within a 1-meter radius of the person listing collectively agreed with the first item, laughed and the second and laughed excessively at the third.</p>

                    <p>The correspondence was sent via digital message. No coherent lexemes were found barring the double-digit numeral present; however, five SCP-9019 instances recollect laughing "extremely hard". One Foundation researcher with a below-average Cognitive Resistance Value entered cardiac arrest upon perceiving the joke but was resuscitated promptly.

                    <p>The invective was said with nonanomalous and nontargetable humans in the vicinity. The collective reacted strongly to the message, to which the SCP-9019 instance responded with the latter sentence.</p>

                    <span class="bold">Addendum 9019.2:</span>
                    <span>Morphology of SCP-9019</span>
                    <p>Autopsy and imaging of SCP-9019 have revealed the following differences between <span class="italic">Homo offendii</span> and that of <span class="italic">Homo sapiens</span>.</p>
                    <p>Significant atrophy of the areas in the brain related to empathy, namely the anterior cingulate complex, the insula and the temporoparietal junction was found. The three regions were partially replaced with a simple biological switch, i.e. the hormones associated with joyous emotions were released upon the negative activation of the original three regions; thus causing a positive feedback loop, wherein the activation of the ACC, the insula and the TPJ releases negative hormones get overridden with the release of overly positive hormones by the biological switch. This change appears to negate original human empathy, instead, releasing such hormones only when other instances or humans are in pain and distress.</p>
                    <p>The limbic system of the brain was heavily affected, entailing the absence of any dysphoric emotions, especially shame and the extreme presence of euphoric emotions, such as those produced by the feedback loop documented above.</p>
                    <p>The digestive system of <span class="italic">Homo offendii</span> has also been changed. For example, stomach acid was 15% weaker on the pH scale and the lining of both the intestines and the colon was weakened. It is hypothesized that such adaptations allow for coprophagy (as fecal matter needed significantly less energy to digest, causing stomach acid to become less acidic and the weakening of the intestines and colon were to release fecal matter to the surrounding areas periodically). It is of note that three hundred grams of fecal matter was found in the areas in proximity to the colon and intestines; how SCP-9019 allows such perforation without infection is unknown.</p>

                    <p>SCP-9019-13445 is a living member of Homo offendii, able to recollect memories in extreme detail (due to SCP-9019-13445's possession of photographic memory) from when it was a nonanomalous human. The following are transcriptions of a series of interviews conducted by Dr. Landon with SCP-9019-13445. It is of note, in the interviews, that SCP-9019-13445 is biologically male.</p>

He just never cared about whatever anyone said about him. And I think that's really cool. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so now I'm just like him. People say I'm an exact copy without any personality but that can't be right. All my friends, well, two of them, him and another, laugh at my jokes often too much. I really like him. Well, not that way, but I'm sure he does like me that wa–</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon <span class="italic">[under his breath]</span>:</span> The pot will call the kettle black.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445:</span> What?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon:</span> Nothing. Did you remember exactly when you "converted"?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445:</span> No. I think it was a gradual thing. I felt my mind twisting from that shame and sadness machine now to this absolutely manic and positive person I am now.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon:</span> Further.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445:</span> It started when I first heard his jokes. Something clicked inside of me, like this was the form I was meant to be all along. I laughed... too much, maniacally even. Then all my negativity cleared. Replaced with who I am, or rather, who he is.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon:</span> Do you have any history with being homophobic, transphobic or racist?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445:</span> It has always been like that. I've fucking hated those [INVECTIVE REDACTED; TARGETED AT HOMOSEXUAL MEN] since I was born, probably. And the [INVECTIVE REDACTED; TARGETED AT AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULACE], god, terrible. I loathe them and seethe at every time I may see them. God bless them if I did what I want to do to them.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon:</span> Hmm... "Homophobia can sometimes be caused by the denial of the self, i.e. you are homosexual yourself but your homophobia can actually amplify itself. It seems that you haven't accepted yourself yet." How do you feel about this statement?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445 <span class="italic">[angrily]</span>:</span> That's definitely fucking wrong. What fucker wrote that? I will punch him and kill him and make him beg for mercy. Saying straight males are gay is fucking offensive and I stand by that.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Dr. Landon:</span> How is homosexuality offensive?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9019-13445 <span class="italic">[angrily]</span>:</span> They are less than human. I am human. I do not want to be compared with them.</p>
