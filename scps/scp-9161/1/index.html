                    <p><span class="bold">Incident Description:</span> On 27/12/2025, the interview detailed in Addendum 9161.3 was conducted. This interview was then followed by a series of attempted interviews with other SCP-9161-B instances; the interviews after, however, resulted in failure due to SCP-9161-B's sudden uncooperativeness.</p>
                    <p>On the following day, 28/12/2025, one SCP-9161-B instance was found attempting to break out of Provisional Site-9161 bounds. This was summarily prevented easily by guards present at the site.</p>
                    <p>The next few days from 29/12/2025 to 05/01/2026 also had break-out attempts on Provisional Site-9161. These attempts were easily interrupted by the Foundation.</p>
                    <p>On 06/01/2026, a large riot caused by the majority of SCP-9161-B instances had broken out of Provisional Site-9161. These instances then wandered seemingly without any destination across the geographical area, being the continent of North America. The Foundation was alerted of this activity, however, the Foundation was only able to recapture 1% of the mass. The exodus then quickly spread across the continent and was considered a global pandemic after one week due to its extreme infectivity.</p>

                        <p>Well. We're fucked, most definitely.</p>
                        <p>The exodus, I guess is what we're calling it now, metastasized throughout North America. It then spread like mosquitoes and it was considered a pandemic by the WHO after a week.</p>
                        <p>We're pretending to be able to have this under control.</p>
                        <p>I mean, I don't really know what to even make of this anymore. I think I should feel worried? If I ever remembered what that meant. I think worried is blue. Blue? I think I remember what that means. Anyways. I don't know.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The Foundation began conducting research on a vaccine as early as the World Health Organization announced that they were considering the anomaly as a pandemic. Vaccine research at first appeared accelerated,</p>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="monospace-inherit">
                        <p>Yeah. I'm sure you people have that under control.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>but was severely abated due to the nature of the bacteria. One month following the declaration, the Foundation, the World Health Organization, the Center of Disease Control along with numerous health organizations began cooperating to create a vaccine. To protect the secrecy of the Veil, this research was conducted in private and a cover story was created.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="monospace-inherit">
                        <p>The Veil above everything, huh? It's funny, really.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The research for the vaccine was declared a top priority for the continued survival of humanity. On 17/02/2026, a worldwide lockdown was enforced in order to reduce the spread of the infection. Quarantine centers were being constructed at an exponential rate by the Foundation, due to the large budget of the organization.</p>
                    <p>The world's response, following the lockdown announcement, was largely hectic and uncoordinated. Anarchy rose sharply due to the great panic experienced by the global populace at the time. It is of note that at the time, approximately 0.5% of humanity (or approximately forty million people) were affected by the infection.</p>

                        <p>This file feels like the color red. It tastes like the color red. There is nothing of value in my statement, but something is better than nothing, right? That's rhetorical. It's false.</p>

                    <p>Despite lockdown efforts, 2% of humanity has been infected. Approximately 98% of the infected have been quarantined.</p>

                            <p class="italic">The footage begins by showing a zoomed-in dandelion globe. Something wilted brown rests on top, along with what seems to be a yellow-shielded stink bug. I'm not an entomologist.</p>
                            <p class="italic">[CONTEXT UNKNOWN] crouches down to have his face on the same level as the globe. He blows on it gently. Nothing flies away from the globe. The globe stands still, with the stink bug still making its way across it.</p>
                            <p class="italic">He blows on the globe harder. Nothing budges. The individual buds shake, appearing to soon fly off. This does not happen. Is it intentionally disappointing me?</p>
                            <p class="italic">He blows on the globe, this time with the anger of a child who just turned twelve to their birthday candle. Nothing budges. The globe stands still, like its stem was made of the same material arched bridges were.</p>
                            <p class="italic">Everything, including the stink bug and the dandelions and the little grass blades behind is still. But not the same still as before. The "still" now feels like a mockery of what once was.</p>
                            <p class="italic">[CONTEXT UNKNOWN] is still, like he is attempting to reminisce about the dream that once was. It is but a dream, a figment.</p>

                        <p>I missed when I would pass through my hometown's market and smell the smell of freshly baked goods. I missed when I could see my mom. I missed when I could taste the pho that the restaurant on the corner of the bakery sold.</p>
                        <p>I missed when I could complain about the weather with my mom, who'd always tell me to 'bear it.'</p>

                            <p class="italic">This was what it'd look like on the drive to the bakery. In the early mornings, at least. Always loved those since my city was hot as fuck. The mornings, in contrast, were very cool. Sometimes frigid.</p>
                            <p class="italic">That apartment there? I have zero idea what it's named now. It's probably gone to ruins or it is going to go to ruins. But it is a landmark to me. Landmarks don't fade, do they?</p>
                            <p class="italic">That's rhetorical. Don't answer that, for it is I know what the answer is.</p>
                            <p class="italic">Seeing the sun above this exact set of apartment buildings was a sign that I'd be getting humanity's greatest invention: sliced bread.</p>

                            <p class="italic">I couldn't help but be slightly enamored by this place. The... I'm not even sure what the ground is made of. Concrete, cold ground. Buzzing, burning LED lights. Cars arranged neatly with some dusty. You'd see the pinnacle of humanity on those dusty cars — crude drawings of... rather suggestive stuff. While it may be stupid, it's human.</p>
                            <p class="italic">The pipes above. I have no idea what happens there, but I know they're there. Like an everlasting dream that's about to end. I was always scared when I walked past those with my mom for some reason. She'd always laugh.</p>
                            <p class="italic">I remember the smell. It smelled like drying paint. Even though every wall, I'm sure, was painted a decade ago. That was before I was even here.</p>
                            <p class="italic">What it meant though, to me was always something to look forward to. The end of every tiring journey was back home, here.</p>
