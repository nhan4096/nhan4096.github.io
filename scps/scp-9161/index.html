For the time being, standard bacterial sterilizing and containment procedures are to be enacted. Under the circumstance that SCP-9161 becomes a worldwide pandemic, partnership with the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control and other health organizations is to be achieved in order to develop a vaccine for SCP-9161. To protect the secrecy of the Veil in the event that this happens, a cover story is to be released and vaccine development is to be done in private.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> SCP-9161 is a bacterial disease spread by an anomalous strain of the bacteria <span class="italic">Clostridium tetani sensoria</span>, henceforth referred to as SCP-9161-A. The propagation of SCP-9161 is via expected bacterial infection means. Patients of SCP-9161, designated SCP-9161-B instances, first display symptoms typical of non-anomalous tetanus. SCP-9161-B instances then fail to develop the symptoms of later stages of tetanus and begin to develop symptoms only present in SCP-9161-A infection. Compiled below are the symptoms indicative of SCP-9161, ordered by typical progression:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acute idiomatic color-blindedness;</li>
                        <li>Nystagmus, i.e. difficulty focusing on objects due to involuntary eye movements;</li>
                        <li>Strabismus, i.e. uncoordination of both eyes;</li>
                        <li>Partial blindness, followed by total blindness;</li>
                        <li>Mild otosclerosis, i.e. the formation of an abnormal bone within the middle ear, treatable with hearing aids;</li>
                        <li>Tinnitus;</li>
                        <li>Sensorineural hearing loss;</li>
                        <li>Progressive anosmia;</li>
                        <li>Total tactile loss;</li>
                        <li>Paresthesia.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is of note however that this illness is not fatal. SCP-9161-B instances are alive during the entirety of its progression, and cause of death throughout all instances are always unrelated to their health condition.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9161-B-3607:</span> Well, it should be nothing. I can't see you. I shouldn't be able to hear you. But I know you're there, from how your words vibrate in here <span class="italic">&lt;gestures to sternum&gt;</span>. That same pressure as when those big speakers play at a concert. Or a team-building event.<br>
                        As for... tactile-wise, pins-and-needles. My skin feels like it's going to burst into thousands upon thousands of pins at any second now. But it isn't painful. Pain to me sounds like the number 13579. All... odd and... jaggly. If that is a word.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nishimura:</span> Hmm... <span class="italic">&lt;holding up a blue pen&gt;</span> could you tell me what color this is?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9161-B-3607:</span> It feels like the pressure underneath 175 meters of mercury. In a submarine made of copper. It feels like a wet crayon at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. You feel like copper. Well, you probably don't have the color of copper. But... you feel like copper. My pain feels like osmium, then.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nishimura:</span> It's blue.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9161-B-3607:</span> Oh. It feels like the Boeing 747, then.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nishimura:</span> <span class="italic">&lt;holding an apple&gt;</span> Now, could you tell me what this is and how it is?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9161-B-3607:</span> It... feels like walking across a field of marshmallow plants. And occasionally feeling wolf spiders on your calf. It feels like the smell of nature on a summer day. It feels like how I imagine the redwood trees would be, although I've never been.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Nishimura:</span> Can you continue?</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">SCP-9161-B-3607:</span> ...it seems to be out of my mind now. Like a dream that knows it's supposed to be ending.</p>

                    <p>Following recommendations by Dr. Andrew Nishimura, he conducted a scientific experiment to determine how SCP-9161-B instances categorize different senses. The control group was uniformly selected D-class, and the SCP-9161-B group is abbreviated as the "Variant" group of the experiment.</p>
