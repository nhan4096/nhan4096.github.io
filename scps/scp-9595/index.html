                        <span>SCP-9595 is a highly unstable non-Euclidean extradimensional space (with Hume levels having a minimum of ten, indicative of extreme reality manipulation), serving as an academic site, Wartrace Lake Middle School. The entrance to SCP-9595 is currently located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. SCP-9595 exhibits its non-Euclidean properties via the sudden manifestation, demanifestation and relocation of corridors, subareas and objects alike. There are no existing staff and pupils within SCP-9595 following Incident 9595-VACANCY.</span>
                        <p>Objects within SCP-9595 have been seen to possess a tendency to move without external intervention; for example, food boxes were found to open with no prior indication and doors open and close suddenly. Floors and corridors within SCP-9595 also exhibit this property, for instance, stairs do not function ordinarily, instead, transiting the person using them to seemingly non-related floors. According to Zeta-9 mission logs (see Addendum 9595.1), corridors were able to transition from one place to another by their own volition.</p>

                        <span>Incident 9595-VACANCY</span>
                        <p>On 22/10/2025, all staff and pupils previously present at SCP-9595 ceased to exist. The disruption was initially noticed when monitoring Foundation guards reported an absence of any ingress to the building. Due to the non-Euclidean nature of the building, the Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 "Mole Rats" was sent to further the investigation. Attached below are transcripts of the mission.</p>

                            <p class="italic">Zeta-9-2 turns and looks down where the stairs they had gone up would be. A solid wall has formed.</p>

                            <p class="italic">The first floor appears to lead to a canteen. The door is open. The lights are off, yet there are multiple storage boxes containing rice made of stainless steel in front of the door.</p>

                            <p class="italic">They walk forward and emerge opposite where they were originally.</p>

                            <p class="italic">There is a number, in stainless steel, reading "I". It is the first floor, as the canteen can be seen.</p>

                            <p class="italic">They ascend the stairs.</p>

                            <p class="italic">Two columns of dark classrooms appear. They are labeled "8A1", "8A2", ... sequentially.</p>

                            <p class="italic">At the front of the classroom is a blackboard. Scribbled in neat letters reads "History: Boston Tea Party".</p>
                            <p class="italic">The three stand in silence in front of the board. Nothing is heard on the recording but the sound of a clock ticking.</p>
                            <p class="italic">The door opens.</p>
                            <p class="italic">The three move out of it. Three storage rice boxes are present.</p>
                            <p class="italic">The boxes open at once. There is rice.</p>
                            <p class="italic">They turn back to look at the door.</p>
                            <p class="italic">It has transformed into the canteen door.</p>

                        <p>On 01/11/2025, following the complete seclusion of SCP-9595 from external ingress as per containment policy, Junior Researcher and Head Researcher of SCP-9595, Dr. John Haines had suffered a Class-T "Teleportation" event to the extradimensional space containing SCP-9595.</p>
                        <p>Upon his body were Foundation first-aid kit tools among other miscellaneous objects usually of general help; of interest however is the Scranton Emergency Transmission Device (SETD) capable of transcribing footage and sending radio signals from extradimensional spaces to baseline reality, such as SCP-9595. Additional information may be provided by the SETD device based on the current context. The following are transcripts over a longitudinal period of two days.</p>

                            <p class="italic">He turns back at the gate. It is now a concrete wall, fifty centimeters in depth.</p>

                                <p>As a former student (duh!), I can't help but feel that I've always been estranged from my classmates in some way or another. It feels like I'm always in that strange limbo half-friend-half-not state?</p>
                                <p>I studied at █████ Elementary School, and if my life was on the line to name four, five people from there, not even friends, I'd die. I remembered when they'd go and hang out and not invite me. If I wanted to be with them &mdash; for a conversation or for hanging out &mdash; I would have to be the <span class="italic">initiator</span>, actively asking them to.</p>
                                <p>About the musical competition thing I wrote about, we'd have celebrations after sessions and after the contest itself. For some reason, they were always sort of underwhelming. They were meant to be bonding, warm moments; but I feel as if they were flat? Coalesce they would, with their best friends and whatever; with me being notably absent (or, to them, not that notable). I drift like a ghost across numerous cliques. They said I was a good friend. They said they enjoyed my company. Not more than others, apparently.</p>
                                <p>Or as I called it, "second-choice friend" and "conditional friendship".</p>

My brethren had seen the horrors within a corner of the wall, a sickly sweet treat, left to kill the colony.

                            <p>They also made us wear a white shirt and dark blue long trousers. Keep in mind, I was learning in a tropical country, which in layman's terms means that it's hot as fuck.

                            <p>There are some lucky days when we'd learn P.E. and we'd be able to wear a slightly more comfortable shirt and trousers. Looking back, maybe not that lucky since I always despised sports or whatever.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> SCP-████ is a minuscule and atomic anomaly affecting the process of magnetization. Nonanomalous magnetization is the process of aligning individual atoms' spin via the induction of an external magnet. This in turn results in the material being magnetized, thus transitioning it to a magnet.</p>
                            <p>Following its discovery, it has been ascertained that SCP-████ causes exactly one atom within such materials being of the diametrically opposite spin. Further attempts at magnetization of the material invariably conclude in the same result, with the same outlier atom differing by its spin to other atoms.</p>

                        <p class="italic">Afar there are footsteps. He acknowledges them by looking around confusedly while turning his body in a full counterclockwise rotation.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The footsteps continue while he sings. The song eventually slows to the same tempo as the footsteps. He walks, to the same rhythm as the footsteps do.</p>

                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk, the floor tiling being small yellow concrete tiles, periodically interrupted by light blue, dark blue and yellow tiles, similar to that of the dark hallway leading to the empty bedroom he had seen earlier.</p>

                                    <p class="italic">A second pen follows, then a third, then thirty more follow. A total of thirty-three pens have fallen from the ceiling.</p>

                                    <p class="italic">The red Pilot G2 pen is the only one with all of its ink missing; the rest have their ink tubes filled wholly.</p>
                                    <p class="italic">He stops looking up and looks forward. He walks, now one-and-a-half times as fast as the tempo of the footsteps and the music.</p>
                                    <p class="italic">The music is identified to be "Lớn Rồi Còn Khóc Nhè" by Trúc Nhân. He sings along to the correct lyrics.</p>
                                    <p class="italic">The doors, swinging on its hinges have had their respective motion augmented. The sound of creaking is louder.</p>

                        <p class="italic">Entering, he sees a group of shadows performing onstage. It is where the singing, the music and the footsteps are from.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They appear to be humanoid-shaped with the expected physique of a thirteen-year-old student.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They do not notice him. He walks to the backstage via an occluded stairway.</p>

The ground is littered with numerous miscellaneous items, for instance wood pallets, dirty and dusty mattresses and various plastic chairs and tables. There is a door made of stainless steel. A spherical prop for the performance is visible.</p>

                        <p class="italic">It is ridden with both fine dust and incense dust. Fingerprints are visible. A plate for burning incense is also seen, however unused and still dust-ridden.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Haines places a finger on it and drags it along the surface. Looking at his finger now, it is full of dust.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Infrequently, an oscillating fan turns to face where the speaker is, and picks up the dust with its wind. The dust flies in countless directions and in intricate, yet organic patterns, ebbs and flows in the air.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The performance continues, the shadows dancing in a hectic and unordered way.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He watches from the left of the backstage.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The singing continues, with some lyrics either wrong or completely not sung.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Some paraphernalia of the performance gets thrown about from the backstage by shadows onto the stage, for no apparent reason. The paraphernalia does not get used at any time during the performance.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The shadows sometimes pause in their dancing, appearing to have forgotten how to.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The microphone and the speaker gets in a feedback loop, making a piercingly high sound which is not fixed until the performance ends.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The performance concludes when all the shadows leave the stage and demanifest promptly after. It culminates in the slow, eventual passing of all the shadows leaving.</p> <p class="italic">He leaves the stage and exits through the main door of the auditorium instead of the side door where he had previously entered from.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Although the two doors are of two different physical positions, he reaches hallway D.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks out onto hallway D.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Creaking noises are heard, this time without any singing, footsteps or music audible.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk, progressively getting darker and darker.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Eventually, he meets a branch, leading to a room.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He enters the room. It is lit up by blue-white bright fluorescent lights, with the ceiling, floors and the wall being cold marble. Four people are present.</p>
                        <p>Who?</p>
                        <p class="italic">They do not notice this. He walks up to them.</p>

                        <p class="italic">They continue to converse in a foreign language and ignore Dr. Haines.</p>

                        <p class="italic">Continuing to walk down hallway D, he meets another branch leading to a room.</p>
                        <p class="italic">It is topologically and spatially the same as the stage in the room labeled Auditorium A, yet it is not physically the same location.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The singing and music continues with frequent interruptions, with no discernible reason or pattern as to why.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The shadows move in hectic patterns, ceasing to when the music stops.</p>

                        <p class="italic">He counts the beats in sync with the music, but not the dancers.</p>
                        <p>█████! I missed you.</p>

                        <p class="italic">The music ceases completely. Shadows group together and converse in a foreign language. Dr. Haines does not join.</p>
                        <p>█████?! ███? ██████?</p>
                        <p class="italic">They are all names, apparently of the shadows. None of the mentioned subjects respond to Dr. Haines but continue to converse.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The conversation loudens, with sounds of laughter erupting frequently throughout.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Haines does not join any conversations nor does he laugh with any of the shadows.</p>
                        <p>███?!</p>
                        <p class="italic">The shadow turns their head momentarily, seeing that Dr. Haines had just called their name. They turn their head back to the conversation immediately.</p>
                        <p>Hey! Not nice.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He exits the room slowly, seeming to grieve the shadows.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Continuing to walk down hallway D, he reaches a branch with a room attached. He enters.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The room he enters appears to be a vast expanse of the outside.</p>
                        <p>No way. No fucking way.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He runs, only to be blocked by an apparently invisible barrier five meters out from the center.</p>
                        <p>No!</p>
                        <p class="italic">Turning back, the expanse appears to be a typical street in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p class="italic">A light pole with multiple utility and electrical poles stretches up from the ground. Wires from the electrical poles line horizontally and clump chaotically at each of the poles.</p>

                        <p class="italic">He walks towards the only home.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The doors are open and the lights are on, yet nobody is home.</p>
                        <p class="italic">On a coathanger rests a white shirt, dark blue trousers, a red tie and underwear.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks upstairs to find a clothesline hanging by an open window, looking out onto the road.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The bed is messy and unmade, pillows and blankets spread across. Next to the bedframe is a closet.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>No. What the actual fuck is happening? Why am I here now? Is this not a school?</p>
                        <p class="italic">He lies down on the bed. His vertebra's cavitation bubbles crack when he lies, twists and turns on the bed.</p>      
                        <p>Ah.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to lie on the bed for the next two minutes. He stands up and descends downstairs.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Downstairs, he enters the kitchen. Dust has settled onto the kitchentop induction heaters. The fridge continues to hum. Knives and other utensils hang from cheaply-made stainless steel hangers. Such utensils are also made of stainless steel. Ceramic bowls are mixed sparsely between stainless steel bowls, the ceramics having a slight grey layer setting atop them.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He opens the fridge, revealing that there is nothing inside. The refrigerator light does not turn on.</p>
                        <p class="italic">In the freezer section above, he opens them to find empty ice trays, dust particles settling on them and freezing. The refrigerator light does not turn on.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He exits the kitchen.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The curtains are fully undone. They are a deep crimson-to-purple shade, intricate and faint patterns on them. Some of the curtains have been exposed to sunlight for such a long duration that they are almost white.</p>
                        <p class="italic">A small gap rests between the two curtains, one where the curtains could not reach. A deep warm yellow shines through, illuminating the room only in that ray. The windows on the door are made of glass, yellowed due to their exposure to the elements.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dust particles fly outwards and inwards in that ray, forming complex yet organic patterns as they do. They move slowly, forming ebbs and flows without any liquid.</p>
                        <p class="italic">A wooden table is visible in the corner. A heavy glass sheet covers the surface, of which is accumulating dust. There is a large speaker on the table, the same model of that in the backstage. It has collected dust the same way that speaker did, incense dust occasionally getting picked up by the infrequent wind of the oscillating fan to reach the sunlight ray.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Speakers and amps litter the table. It looks to be a guitarists' paraphernalia.</p>
                        <p>My grandpa was a guitarist. I think so. I think it wasn't one of those ordinary guitars, but those traditional ones?</p>
                        <p>I was never that into the music, but it wasn't terrible. I remember the nights me and him would spend downstairs, with the same fan oscillating back and forth to provide us some relief to the heat and jamming to the music.</p>
                        <p class="italic">A ragged cloth is on the table. It is dry, dust collecting and seemingly forming a crust on the cloth.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Yellowed and dust-accumulating pottery is in the corner of the room. Intricate golden and blue patterns are present on the pottery, indicative of Sino-Vietnamese-style patterning.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He exits the home, taking a prolonged amount of time looking back at the home before he finally exits.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Entering back into the hallway, he continues walking.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues walking.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Reaching a branch, he enters the room at the terminus of it.</p>
                        <p class="italic">It is a basketball field.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Shadows play basketball while shouting in a foreign and unintelligible language. They do not notice when Dr. Haines enters.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks to the back of the basketball field, looking at the grass and the rocks.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He picks a rock up, examining it carefully.</p>
                        <p>I don't play basketball. I remember when the P.E. teacher would force us to play, but I don't think he was that competent anyway. I sneaked out to the back and looked at the ground, at the sky and at whatever that wasn't basketball nor my friends &mdash; well &mdash; throwing insults at each other like it was war.</p>
                        <p>To this day, I still don't understand the sport nor its unsportsmanlike athletes being handsomely rewarded for their behavior.</p>  
                        <p class="italic">He continues to examine the rock, eventually realizing that it is in fact not a rock but a large chunk of broken concrete.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He tosses it back into the grass.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Crouching down, he inspects the grass.</p>
                        <p>...Aromatic Kylinga. Don't know the scientific name for that, not a botanist either. Just like plants. This one grew a lot where I grew up.</p>
                        <p>And that's Billygoat Weed. Ageratum conyzoides, that I remember.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Standing up, he walks towards the soccer field. It is made of impossibly-lush artificial grass, each bristle standing up against Dr. Haines' feet. No actual plants are there for Dr. Haines to inspect and identify.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He crouches down and drags his hand across the grass. The grass gives way momentarily then straightens again.</p>    
                        <p class="italic">Small plastic granules suddenly appear from between the blades. It seems to be the plastic base of the grass peeling off.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to drag his hand across the grass, while such granules keep appearing. He moves the granules into one place.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to drag his hand across the grass, each blade falling then straightening save for one impossibly brown and dry grass, detaching from the base when he contacts it.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He looks at the dry blade, seeming to empathize with it despite its inanimate form.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The netting around the soccer field seems to be collapsing. Large, gaping holes are present and spread out throughout the netting, while individual fiber strands fray. The front door is barely hanging on to its hinge, when a twenty-two shadow group enters, ignoring Dr. Haines' presence. The door falls off the hinge, with the stainless steel once constituting it rust and breaks due to how brittle it has become.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The shadow group begins to assume movements similar to that of what would happen in a soccer game. Distant chanting, chatting and laughter is heard, conversing in a foreign language.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Haines is standing on the edge of the grass, looking in silence at the shadow group. At no point do the shadows acknowledge Dr. Haines.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks out, through the gaping hole in the netting and walks slowly and backwards while looking at the shadows. He continues to walk backwards on the basketball field, a blank affect on his face.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks out from the branch back to hallway D.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He continues to walk, reaching a branch and entering its terminus.</p>
                        <p class="italic">It appears to be a social gathering of a large number of shadows.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The room they are in looks to be a cafeteria, with numerous stainless steel tables and chairs. The shadow instances have all assumed a seat.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The audio on the footage is loud.</p>
                        <p class="italic">They have all coalesced into their respective groups, some as small as two and some as large as thirteen.</p>        
                        <p>Hey!</p>
                        <p class="italic">None respond. Dr. Haines repeats it louder.</p>
                        <p>Hey!</p>
                        <p class="italic">None respond.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks around the groups, each conversing in a foreign language. None notice his presence, until he reaches one who turns their head and promptly returns back to the conversation without physical acknowledgement of Dr. Haines.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The groups continue to converse, with laughter interspersed throughout.</p>
                        <p>Seems they're having a fun time. For the greater good I should not join, I guess.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Haines does not laugh nor does he hold a conversation to any of the shadows throughout the footage.</p>
                        <p class="italic">Dr. Haines accidentally bumps into one of the shadows physically.</p>
                        <p>Sorry.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The group which that shadow is part of collectively turn their head at Dr. Haines, stares for seven seconds and returns to their conversation.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He walks towards another table, and inspects it closely, kneeling down to do so. His motion is noticed by the shadows, who stare at him, seeming to judge before returning to their conversation shortly after.</p>
                        <p class="italic">His reflection is morphed into ebbs and flows on the distorted stainless steel table surface. There is a noticeably larger granule of dust on the table, not being set off by the wind.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He inspects the granule, seeming to empathize with it as his affect turns relaxed.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He crushes the granule. It splits into countless smaller granules, all of which immediately get picked up by the wind and fly away in countless directions.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The shadows do not notice his motion for a second time.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He stands up, walking towards a wall to inspect.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The wall is made of fake wooden tiling. It tiles in haphazard patterns, but seems to have a common denominator of being somewhat square.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The wall is covered in a thin yet noticeable layer of dust. Dragging his finger across, he knows what is to be expected but he still does so. He picks up his finger and sees that it is contaminated with dust.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He rubs it onto his white shirt, dirtying it with a slight grayish color.</p>
                        <p class="italic">The wall is now concrete.</p>
                        <p class="italic">It is apparent that the wall has not been cleaned for a long time. Layered atop the wall are depressions and peaks, bearing semblance to natural formations, but they are simply made of misshaped concrete.</p>
                        <p class="italic">There seems to be more inanimate objects that Dr. Haines appreciates, in all of the rooms, than there are animate objects that he appreciates.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He navigates carefully, making sure not to bump into any of the shadows towards the exit.</p>
                        <p class="italic">He turns back at the gathering, appearing to long for the shadows.</p>
                        <p class="italic">It takes a prolonged amount of time for him to finally turn forwards and exit the branch.</p>
                        <p>Just... Why do I miss them?</p>
