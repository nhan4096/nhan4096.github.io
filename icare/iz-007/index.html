M006-MONT ROSS, should it pass, will start a draft for selected field operative personnel to explore Mont Ross, as this is a location of interest in the Typo Degradation Incident investigation, detailed at <a href="../iz-006/index.html">IZ-006</a>.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">FOREWORD</span>: This meeting was hosted on ██/██/20██ 17:30 as the initial discussion of M006-MONT ROSS.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold">[BEGIN MEETING TRANSCRIPTION]</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-1</span>: Good morning, everyone. Today's meeting is to discuss M006-MONT ROSS about whether or not we should send field agents to Mont Ross to continue the investigation into the Typo Degradation Incident.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-2</span>: Thanks. As you all know, the TDI has disrupted multiple documents, especially the IZ-005 series. I assume you have read the log file showcasing the sudden access elevation caused by guest_?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3, L5-4, L5-5, L5-6, L5-7</span>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-2</span>: While the data's messy, we've tracked down guest_ based on IP range estimation to Mont Ross, in the French and Southern Antarctic Lands.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3 [skeptically]</span>: Messy data isn't proof, or at least it isn't very convincing. This could be a fault in our estimation attempt or whoever is behind guest_, if there is at all, trying to mislead us.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-4</span>: Again, we're risking extreme systemic loss of integrity here. Mont Ross is the furthest lead we've gotten in the investigation.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3</span>: Agreed, but sending field operatives blindly might be a waste of lives and resources.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-7</span>: Have we considered the possibility that guest_ is a metaphysical anomaly?The IP range estimation leading to Mont Ross is clearly absurd. guest_ might not be physical at all, like we've speculated.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-6</span>: It is possible, but this possibility is much less likely than any others. I think we should focus on the more probable ones first.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: We do know that the entity behind the Ultra Interface channel, heavily linked to XT-related anomalies may be metaphysically affected. For example, there is a supported hypothesis stating that xUI is an anti-personality, appealing to no one yet gaining viewership anonymously.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-1</span>: Let's keep this grounded. For all we know, guest_ could as easily be a vandalous attacker who managed to infiltrate our system. They did leave multiple cryptic messages with no context, like "THE CAPSIZE IS COMING", for example. It seems more to me that guest_ is a vandal.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3</span>: I think, for a vandal to get past multiple layers of protection in such a swift manner is implausible. The possibility of it being metaphysical is still open.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-7</span>: Given the possibility of risks, both tangible and intangible, I propose a limited version of M006. It'll prioritize remote surveillance and avoid direct contact until we better understand the anomaly.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-4</span>: Agreed.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: Agreed also. We should allocate resources towards debriefing field operatives on XT-metaphysical anomalies.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3</span>: I second that.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-1</span>: All in favor of the limited M006 motion?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-3, L5-6, L5-4, L5-5</span>: Aye.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-1</span>: Alright, motion passed.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><span class="bold">BACKGROUND</span>: The region was first flagged during the TDI investigation, as the result of an IP range estimation of an infiltrator under the user guest_.

                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Begin recording. Currently stationed at Davis Station, ready to deploy.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: You may begin.</p>

                    <p class="italic center">(The drone takes off. It begins accelerating.)</p>

                    <p class="italic center">(T+1m. It has moved approximately one kilometer away from Davis Station.)</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(The feed is of the Southern Ocean.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Drone is stable. Weather is calm, expected for this part of the ocean.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: Good. Remember to calibrate sensors based on possible metaphysical anomalies, should they show up.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Roger that.</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(The drone continues to fly. The waves below are soft.)</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(T+23m. It has reached stable velocity, and will stay that way until it reaches Mont Ross, the destination.)</p>

                    <p class="italic center">(The flight continues from T+5h to T+7h34m with no interruptions. The feed is darker as the sun has set at 18:38. The feed begins to have a static-like noise on top. Agent ██████ does not appear to be aware of this, until T+7h34m.)</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(T+7h34m. The drone is approximately 525 kilometers away from Mont Ross.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Uh, L5?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: Yes?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: You see that? The staticky thing over the drone's feed?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">L5-5</span>: Yes. Huh, interesting. Can you try to recalibrate the feed to account for this possible metaphysics anomaly? Also, try to get a LFU reading, if it's possible. LFU should be used to measure content, but in this case, it might work because the drone feed is technically "content".</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Sure, recalibrating now.</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(The noise on top of the feed increases sharply, but slowly decreases as Agent ██████ recalibrates it. The noise is still visible on the feed, however.)</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Agent ██████</span>: Anyways, LFU reading's 37.3. That's... dangerously high. I think it's safe to say that we're dealing with a metaphysical anomaly here.</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(The flight continues from T+7h36m to T+9h59 with no interruptions, barring the continued increase in static-like noise over the feed.)</p>
