                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">SUMMARY</span>: Over the past fourteen days (██/██/2025 &mdash; ██/██/2025), the ICaRE database has experienced a statistically significant number of mistakes, notably containing traces of XT-related anomalies. Documents <a href="../iz-005/3/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.3</a>, <a href="../iz-005/4/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.4</a> and <a href="../iz-005/5/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.5</a> were discovered to have multiple typographical errors (such as capitalization, transposition or absence of certain letters) and grammatical errors (such as comma splices). This phenomenon has been tentatively named the "Typo degradation Incident".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Specifically, here are a selection of quotes from affected material showcasing typographical and grammatical errors present:</p>
                <div>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="italic">"Dischronometria..."</p>
                        <p>From <a href="../iz-005/3/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.3</a>. This should be "dyschronometria".</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>

                        <p>From <a href="../iz-005/3/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.3</a>. This should be "inability".</p>

                        <p>From <a href="../iz-005/4/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.4</a>. This should be "Press Start 2P", showcasing a capitalization error.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="italic">"...tesselation..."</p>
                        <p>From <a href="../iz-005/4/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.4</a>. This should be "tessellation", showcasing the absence of the letter L and thus a grammatical error.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="italic">"...collective human consciousness, this renders..."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="italic">"...FOERWORD..."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="italic">"...██\██/202█ 10:35."</p>
                        <p>From <a href="../iz-005/5/index.html">IZ-005.5</a>. The singular backslash should be a forward one, showcasing a typographical error.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Also of interest is the extreme degradation imposed on to Sector &alpha;&mdash;01, which is the main sector, containing most of ICaRE's documentation. Access logs to Sector &alpha;&mdash;01 with ID "access" during the two-week period in which the Typo degradation Incident was happening. Present in the log file are an abundance of document edits by the user "guest_", with vague edit messages such as "THE CAPSIZE IS COMING". This could suggest that the incident was caused by a malicious human attacker, not by an anomaly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The users guest and guest_ have been geolocated via approximation of IP ranges. However, this method of analysis although usually helpful and correct, returns nonsensical results. For example, on ██/██/202█ 12:03, both users guest_ and guest were identified to be located at (-49.58324129837741, 69.48879648443263), namely, "Mont Ross" on the French and Southern Antarctic Lands. This result is obviously false, and could point towards both the users being a metaphysical anomaly rather than being a human-controlled attacker.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A motion (named M006-MONT ROSS) has been passed on to the L5 Council deciding whether or not to send field operatives to the aforementioned location. See document <a href="../iz-007/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-007</a> for more information regarding this motion.</p>
