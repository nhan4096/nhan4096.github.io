                <p>The Interface Containment and Research Effort (shortened as ICaRE), is a specialized division made by the Brainrot Group. The central entity being studied is an anomalous channel named Ultra Interface, thereafter referred to as UI. </p>
                <br>
                <p>UI is part of a larger alliance known as Xitray Team, abbreviated as XT. Another person of interest also from XT is T6, the details of which are also partly researched within ICaRE.</p>
                <br>
                <p>ICaRE's goal is to contain and research UI, NT (known as T6 in alternate Brainrot documentation, see Project T6. Note that he uses a different persona to that of T6 or NT online.) and other Xitray Team-associated anomalies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Personnel are assigned security levels, which can be used to access ICaRE documents with the same security level or lower. Your security level is <span id="security-level" class="bold"></span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All documents are classified as IZ-[document number]. IZ stands for Interface Zero, a codename for Ultra Interface. Some documents are also protected under clearance codes, usually to deter personnel at risk of being affected by Ultra Interface memetic effects.</p>
