                <p><span class="bold">SUMMARY</span>: This document attempts to analyse NT's Alternate Reality Game, hosted using GitHub Pages, whose domain is at ████████.github.io.</p>
                <br>
                <p>NT's Alternate Reality Game (henceafter referred to as NTARG) was created on April 28th, 2025, approximately one year after his initial onset of FCE symptoms. NTARG was considered unlikely to be finished due to the extreme mental dysfunction as experienced by NT, caused by his Stage 5 FCE, which entails the absence of creative thought and critical thinking as one of its symptoms. As of the time of writing, NTARG is presumably not finished.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The design choices behind NTARG are widely considered repulsive by most critics. When asked about this, NT defended his website by stating that it was "minimalistic" and that "most people wouldn't understand it". This is consistent with symptoms such as the development of a superiority complex and adoption of Ultra Interface-style design choices. NTARG utilizes bright colors in contrast with the pure black background, using the font Arial as its default. As some of NTARG's dialogue was planned to be emotional, the use of such font and such color choices cause a Cognitive Dissonance Score of 98 out of 100, with 0 being the state of absolute emotional alignment and 100 being the use of bubbly and childish fonts for emotional dialogue. NTARG, as it was created by a person affected by late-stage FCE, also has LFU-positive readings and effects on viewers. An interview log with NT regarding NTARG is documented at <a href="5/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.5</a>.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">HOMEPAGE ANALYSIS</span>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Text constantly flash between different colors, increasing the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Where NT's online identity's name was placed.</li>
                    <li>Checkbox controls whether or not "screensaver" easter egg is shown. The randomness of such feature also increases the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Controls whether or not background music is playing. Track appears to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrCp8AHdgEM">"14. Welcome to the Green Room" by Toby Fox</a>. Music described as "upbeat" by most, increasing the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Such description removes the illusion of the fourth wall, increasing the CDS of NTARG via use of keywords like "fun" to describe NTARG.</li>
                    <li>This statement is true. Website appears to be recursively in development, due to endless integration of UI-style design choices, affected by Stage 5 FCE.</li>
                    <li>When asked about this, NT stated that anonimity, while common in most ARGs, is unneeded in his as he aims to be "quirky" and "modernist".</li>
                    <li>Saved via Firebase. Subject to change.</li>
                    <li>Counted via GitHub commit count. Note the extreme abundance of commits only within 4 months, the majority of which are described as "minor bug fixes"</li>
                    <li>Mainly small subunits of randomly assorted interactable websites, namely, the "Epic Button", a button which tracks the number of clicks via Firebase, a keylogger which logs keys being pressed, a random number generator, a DVD logo screensaver (previously mentioned in (3)) and a text editor which is a singular input form with three buttons, two of which are saving to different formats and the remaining one is to open a text file.</li>
                    <li>Login page, appears to be of purely entertainment as no data gets saved.</li>
                    <li>Credits page. Analysis is at <a href="1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>.</li>
                    <li>Splash text, chosen randomly from a list. Analysis is at <a href="2/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.2</a>.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>NTARG's source code is divided into two main subdirectories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>assets: audio, images, video, JSON and JavaScript files;</li>
                    <li>html: the main webpages of NTARG, containing, as of July 27th, 2025: camel, cats, conversation, credits (analysed at <a href="1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>), cursed, experiments, games, login, microwave, mobile, piano, place, shop, spawn, static, subspace-tripmine and tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following is an analysis of subdirectories within NTARG. This analysis was written at 06/08/2025, 10 hours following the commit with hash b5df9e94f9e66c048a7d1a2e5cf493acd710e20d. NTARG and this analysis is subject to change, due to NT continuously rolling out minor updates which never fulfill any objective to finish the ARG.</p>

                        <td>The main directory has two subdirectories (/1 and /2) and one HTML file. The HTML file located at /html/conversation shows centered red text in the font of "Special Elite" reading "[ACCESS DENIED]". This is a likely attempt of being "edgy". The HTML file located at /html/conversation/1 utilises Arial for the inital timestamp and Fredoka for the conversation. Due to the roundedness of the latter's font and the emotional nature of the conversation, this is the only webpage on NTARG that reaches a CDS of 100. Attached at the end is a cryptic faux error message written in Arial with multiple bright color choices. This faux error message is also the entirety of the content in the HTML file located at /html/conversation/2. An analysis of the mentioned conversation is saved to ICaRE at <a href="3/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.3</a>.</td>

Based on the use of the exclamation mark and the title of the page, NT might enjoy the pain and suffering of others, which might be a side effect of the Stage 5 FCE superiority complex.</td>

This webpage is likely an attempt at both "quirkiness" and humor, based on the random nature of such content. It is suspected that FCE patients may experience humor differently than others, akin to that of the personality inversion effect.</td>

The title of the page "SpawnLocation", possibly boasting about his programming skills via naming conventions. Most likely an attempt to be cryptic.</td>

                        <td>Page content states "this page is under development. check back later!". Above the text is an image of a Subspace Tripmine, an item collectible in some Roblox entertainment units. Upon clicking on it, one of three random sounds located at "/assets/audio/sfx/sstm/activate.mp3", "/assets/audio/sfx/sstm/pulse.mp3", "/assets/audio/sfx/sstm/explosion.mp3" is played. Due to the continued repetition of this item, it is suspected that NT's entire personality is of this inanimate object, which may be another symptom of Stage 5 FCE, namely, the adoption of personality traits relating to those of inanimate or fictional objects.</td>

                        <td>Page content is "the Tree" in the video game Deltarune. Page title is "i think ive seen it somewhere in the past...", again, trying to be cryptic. Due to his late-stage FCE, he is uncapable of producing new artwork (due to the collapse of creative thinking), which is why he reuses this image.</td>

The text shown is "so... / you cracked the code. / congrats. / unfortunately, i have bad news for you. / there's nothing here. / you wasted your time.". NT berates the reader, likely feeding into his sadistic ideologies caused by FCE disease. Although he claims that NTARG codes and ciphers are "completely secret", he includes the full code in plaintext without any encrytion. To "remedy" this, he discourages the reader from viewing the GitHub repository containing the code for NTARG.</td>
