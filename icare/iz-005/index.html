                <p><span class="bold">SUMMARY</span>: This document attempts to analyse NT's Alternate Reality Game, hosted using GitHub Pages, whose domain is at ████████.github.io.</p>
                <br>
                <p>NT's Alternate Reality Game (henceafter referred to as NTARG) was created on April 28th, 2025, approximately one year after his initial onset of FCE symptoms. NTARG was considered unlikely to be finished due to the extreme mental dysfunction as experienced by NT, caused by his Stage 5 FCE, which entails the absence of creative thought and critical thinking as one of its symptoms. As of the time of writing, NTARG is presumably not finished.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The design choices behind NTARG are widely considered repulsive by most critics. When asked about this, NT defended his website by stating that it was "minimalistic" and that "most people wouldn't understand it". This is consistent with symptoms such as the development of a superiority complex and adoption of Ultra Interface-style design choices. NTARG utilizes bright colors in contrast with the pure black background, using the font Arial as its default. As some of NTARG's dialogue was planned to be emotional, the use of such font and such color choices cause a Cognitive Dissonance Score of 98 out of 100, with 0 being the state of absolute emotional alignment and 100 being the use of bubbly and childish fonts for emotional dialogue. NTARG, as it was created by a person affected by late-stage FCE, also has LFU-positive readings and effects on viewers.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">HOMEPAGE ANALYSIS</span>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Text constantly flash between different colors, increasing the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Where NT's online identity's name was placed.</li>
                    <li>Checkbox controls whether or not "screensaver" easter egg is shown. The randomness of such feature also increases the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Controls whether or not background music is playing. Track appears to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrCp8AHdgEM">"14. Welcome to the Green Room" by Toby Fox</a>. Music described as "upbeat" by most, increasing the CDS of NTARG.</li>
                    <li>Such description removes the illusion of the fourth wall, increasing the CDS of NTARG via use of keywords like "fun" to describe NTARG.</li>
                    <li>This statement is true. Website appears to be recursively in development, due to endless integration of UI-style design choices, affected by Stage 5 FCE.</li>
                    <li>When asked about this, NT stated that anonimity, while common in most ARGs, is unneeded in his as he aims to be "quirky" and "modernist".</li>
                    <li>Saved via Firebase. Subject to change.</li>
                    <li>Counted via GitHub commit count. Note the extreme abundance of commits only within 4 months, the majority of which are described as "minor bug fixes"</li>
                    <li>Mainly small subunits of randomly assorted interactable websites, namely, the "Epic Button", a button which tracks the number of clicks via Firebase, a keylogger which logs keys being pressed, a random number generator, a DVD logo screensaver (previously mentioned in (3)) and a text editor which is a singular input form with three buttons, two of which are saving to different formats and the remaining one is to open a text file.</li>
                    <li>Login page, appears to be of purely entertainment as no data gets saved.</li>
                    <li>Credits page. Analysis is at <a href="1/index.html">IZ-005.1</a>.</li>
                    <li>Splash text, chosen randomly from a list. Analysis is at <a href="2/index.html">IZ-005.2</a>.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>NTARG's source code is divided into two main subdirectories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>assets: audio, images, video, JSON and JavaScript files;</li>
                    <li>html: the main webpages of NTARG, containing, as of July 27th, 2025: camel, cats, conversation, credits (analysed at <a href="1/index.html">IZ-005.1</a>), cursed, experiments, games, login, microwave, mobile, piano, place, shop, spawn, static, subspace-tripmine and tree.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Further analysis of subdirectories are pending.</p>
