                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">ANALYSIS</span>: A hypothesis regarding this log is that it is a metaphor for NT's Stage 5 FCE's symptoms and his attempt to "vent" such thoughts. The two characters speaking may be representative of his FCE-Schizophrenia diagnosis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>"<span class="italics">[APRIL 17 202<span class="red">X</span> 7:31 AM]</span>": Note the redacted timestamp. This may be caused by Stage 5 FCE dyschronometria. FCE-Dyschronometria is caused by the continued worsening of addiction to LFU-positive content, often consuming such content mindlessly altering the subject's perception of time.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-m italics">...are you serious? going back to the <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> for the second time?</span>": Due to unclear nature of the log, it is not known whether NT is talking about his FCE, the mental institution in which he is being held at (ICaRE FCE Medical Ward 1), or an imaginary space of unknown purpose.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">yeah, of course. i will be there tonight. we NEED to do something about this situation.</span>": Previous version of the second sentence was "<span class="convo-t italics">i will there tonight.</span>". Due to the absence of the verb "be", it is presumed that this is caused by linguistic degredation caused by FCE. The "situation" could possibly be his containment at the FCE medical ward. Based on the FCE-Schizophrenia diagnosis, it is plausible that he believes that his personality are split between these two characters.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-m italics">that place is insanely dangerous, dont you know that?</span>": Note the use of the invalid word and possible typo: "dont". This may also be representative of FCE linguistic regression, in conjunction with the non-existent capitalization pattern. If "that place" mentioned is in fact the hospital where NT is held at, the "danger" described possibly could be ICaRE personnel. The main reason for this aversion is that ICaRE personnel are required to deny his delusions, including, but not limited to: an imaginary sword, knife or other sharp pointed object, an imaginary person named "Nooby", the existence and animacy of an object named "Subspace Tripmine", and the FCE-based delusion that LFU-positive content is, quote, "objectively good".</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">i mean, come on, what are we gonna do then? leave her in there forever and do nothing about it?</span> / <span class="convo-m italics">alright. im counting on you.</span>": Who the word "her" is referring to, if "she" even is a person (this hypothesis is still possible due to FCE patients personifying inanimate objects) is intentionally ambiguous. Possible entities that "her" could refer to: Noobey (see Credits analysis at <a href="../1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>), Subspace Tripmine (an esoteric inanimate and fictional object with unknown semantic meaning) and NT's classmate and parasocial friend briefly mentioned at Credits analysis in <a href="../1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>. It is unclear how this briefly mentioned "her" relates to NTARG, if at all, due to NT's continued mental regression and inability to produce creative thought.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">nobody else is supposed to know about this, and if you cant return, then im the only one who can.</span> / <span class="convo-m italics">fine, be careful tho.</span>": This line further supports the hypothesis that this dialogue is between multiple FCE-Schizophrenia internal personas. The use of "return" implies that the speaker has visited this location more than once, possibly signifying that this location is a psychological state instead of a physical location. The clause "I'm the only one who can" is a pending symptom of FCE Stage 5, namely, forming self-fragmented heroism in order to cope with Stage 5 paranoia and powerlessness.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">dont worry, ive dealt with <span class="convo-u">them</span> multiple times.</span> / <span class="convo-m italics">alright. im counting on you.</span>": The first sentence again shows the self-fragmented heroism associated with FCE-Schizophrenia late-stage paranoia and disassociation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The faux "corrupted file" warning at the end is in an attempt to sound esoteric and appear cryptic. This completely fails however due to the use of the font Arial (not preserved here due to cognitohazard concerns) and the use of bright colors (as most computer messages do not use such palette).</p>
