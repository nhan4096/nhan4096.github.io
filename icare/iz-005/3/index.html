                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">ANALYSIS</span>: A hypothesis regarding this log is that it is a metaphor for NT's Stage 5 FCE's symptoms and his attempt to "vent" such thoughts. The two characters speaking may be representative of his FCE-Schizophrenia diagnosis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>"<span class="italics">[APRIL 17 202<span class="red">X</span> 7:31 AM]</span>": Note the redacted timestamp. This may be caused by Stage 5 FCE dyschronometria. FCE-D<span class="typo" id="typo-13">i</span>schronometria is caused by the continued worsening of addiction to LFU-positive content, often consuming such content mindlessly altering the subject's perception of time.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-m italics">...are you serious? going back to the <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> for the second time?</span>": Due to unclear nature of the log, it is not known whether NT is talking about his FCE, the mental institution in which he is being held at (ICaRE FCE Medical Ward 1), or an imaginary space of unknown purpose.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">yeah, of course. we NEED to do something about this situation. we cant just leave <span class="convo-j">her</span> in there forever.</span>": Previous version of the second sentence was "<span class="convo-t italics">i will there tonight.</span>". Due to the absence of the verb "be", it is presumed that this is caused by linguistic degradation caused by FCE. The "situation" could possibly be his containment at the FCE medical ward. Based on the FCE-Schizophrenia diagnosis, it is plausible that he believes that his personality are split between these two characters.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-m italics">of course i want to save <span class="convo-j">her</span>, but i can't return there because <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>.</span>": Previous version of this dialogue utilized grammar mistakes, namely, "dont". This may also be representative of FCE linguistic regression, in conjunction with the non-existent capitalization pattern. If "that place" mentioned is in fact the hospital where NT is held at, the "danger" described possibly could be ICaRE personnel. The main reason for this aversion is that ICaRE personnel are required to deny his delusions, including, but not limited to: an imaginary sword, knife or other sharp pointed object, an imaginary person named "Nooby", the existence and animacy of an object named "Subspace Tripmine", and the FCE-based delusion that LFU-positive content is, quote, "objectively good". Also note that the "danger" described is redacted, likely in an attempt to seem bureaucratic or cryptic, however this fails because of the pure amateurish nature of NTARG. The redaction also shows the lack of creative thinking and complete failure to create original plotlines, instead relying on the reader to hypothesize. Who the word "her" is referring to, if "she" even is a person (this hypothesis is still possible due to FCE patients personifying inanimate objects) is intentionally ambiguous. Possible entities that "her" could refer to: Noobey (see Credits analysis at <a href="../1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>), Subspace Tripmine (an esoteric inanimate and fictional object with unknown semantic meaning) and NT's classmate and parasocial friend briefly mentioned at Credits analysis in <a href="../1/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-005.1</a>. It is unclear how this briefly mentioned "her" relates to NTARG, if at all, due to NT's continued mental regression and <span class="typo" id="typo-12">u</span>nability to produce creative thought.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">i guess i'll go alone then.</span> / <span class="convo-m italics">are you sure you'll be fine if you're all by yourself?</span>": This line signifies "heroism" demonstrated by FCE patients. Due to the superiority complex adopted at this stage of disease, FCE patients believe that they are "better" and thus "heroic".</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">nobody else is supposed to know about this, and if you cant return, then im the only one who can.</span> / <span class="convo-m italics">fine, be careful tho.</span>": This line further supports the hypothesis that this dialogue is between multiple FCE-Schizophrenia internal personas. The use of "return" implies that the speaker has visited this location more than once, possibly signifying that this location is a psychological state instead of a physical location. The clause "I'm the only one who can" is a pending symptom of FCE Stage 5, namely, forming self-fragmented heroism in order to cope with Stage 5 paranoia and powerlessness.</p>
                <p>"<span class="convo-t italics">dont worry, <span class="convo-u">they</span> cant harm me.</span>": Again shows the self-fragmented heroism associated with FCE-Schizophrenia late-stage paranoia and dissociation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The faux "corrupted file" warning at the end is in an attempt to sound esoteric and appear cryptic. This completely fails however due to the use of the font Arial (not preserved here due to cognitohazard concerns), the use of bright colors (as most computer messages do not use such a palette) and the presence of the unorthodox asterisk.</p>
