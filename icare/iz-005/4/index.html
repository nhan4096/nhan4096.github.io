                <p><span class="bold">VERBATIM TEXT</span>: Plaintext is preserved, however stylistic choices have been stripped. This text is from the "static" page. Originally this text was rendered in the font "Press Start 2<span class="typo" id="typo-9">p</span>", attempting to emulate a 1990-era aesthetic. The background noise being played is of static. The background is a seemingly pre-generated random <span class="typo" id="typo-10">tesselation</span> of white and black tiles, meant to illustrate television snow.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">TEXT ANALYSIS</span>: The above text oscillates between states of pessimistic nihilism ("your acts are meaningless.") and hopeful and forced optimistic delusion ("you still have a chance.", "keep going." and "don't give up"). Attempts to reconcile such contradictions only result in semantic looping, causing such text to lose all semantic meaning and thus vanish within the collective human consciousness<span class="typo" id="typo-11">,</span> this renders the intended message of this text (presumably to "keep going") obsolete. The result is thus a blend of: dissociation, false agency and meaning detached from "aesthetic meaning".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Combined with the attempted emulation of retro-style design, this webpage serves no purpose aside from those concerned with its aesthetic. It functions not as a motivational message, but instead as meaningless information, only invested in the act of bringing "aesthetic meaning" to readers.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">QR ANALYSIS</span>: This part of the document serves to analyse the page titled "hidden in plain sight.", hosted at ████████.github.io/html/static/qr.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The page's background is a solid black color. Its only content is that of a transparent PNG file of a QR code. When scanned, it reveals that the QR code is simply a red herring, linking to NTARG's 404 page with nothing changed. The HTML source code reveals that the body of the webpage is configured to the font "Press Start 2P", the same font used in ████████.github.io/html/static. Paragraph blocks are also configured to specific font sizes and colors, although both the font choice, sizing and colors are never used as the image aforementioned was the only content on the page.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When viewed from the Debug console, a message printed from console.log() reads: "<span class="typo" id="typo-8">q</span>bairefngvba.mp3". The first ciphered part of the name is a Caesar cipher. When decoded using ROT13, it decodes to "conversation". This is a reference to another webpage, whose analysis is at <a href="../3/index.html">IZ-005.3</a>. The crosslinking aligns with NTARG's broader overuse of meaningless connections disguised as complexity.</p>
