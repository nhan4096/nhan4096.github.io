                    <p><span class="bold">FOREWORD</span>: This interview was conducted on ██/██/202█ 18:25, following a sequence of continuous and sudden improvement in FCE disease. NT showed signs of continuation of NTARG, namely making 50 commits within 1 month, however most commits only adding "coming soon" webpages. The interview was conducted in ICaRE FCE Medical Ward 1.</p>

                    <p class="center italic">(The feed flickers in. Dr. Wood is not wearing earmuffs, in spite of the regulation stating so. The faint hum-buzz of the flourescent lightning is audible. Also audible is NCS music, specifically "Spectre" by Alan Walker. NT is facing upwards in order to watch his prescribed LFU-positive content.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Good evening. Please state your name and designation for the record.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: Besttuber. And you don't actually mean that when you say "Good evening".</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: It is standard procedure. Also, please state your true designation, instead of fictional ones.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT [begrudgingly]</span>: [REDACTED]. </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Great. So tell me, what is your "ARG" at ███████.github.io exactly?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: One, please call it BestARG. Two, my BestARG is an original Alternate Reality Game. Avant-garde. Revolutionary. One of a kind. Unique. Special. It will be the best of all websites, archives, games, ARGs, art or creative work, of the past, the present, the future and maybe in another timeline. Yes.</p>
                    <p class="center italic">(NT briefly pauses. He blinks once, which is unusual for FCE patients as they choose to not participate in any activity that could interrupt their LFU-positive content viewing.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: You know. When I'm dead. They'll study me. They'll ask "Who was this guy?". They'll ask "How was he so smart?". Nobody'll know who made it or&mdash;</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood [under his breath, interrupting NT]</span>: If only you didn't stamp the entire thing with your name on it...</p>
                    <p class="center italic">(Dr. Wood rolls his eyes. NT does not seem to be aware about this fact, as he is preoccupied with his ceiling-mounted monitor.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Guard</span>: Please follow standard procedure. Don't attempt to shatter FCE patients' complex, please.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Brilliant. Moving on, what is your AR&mdash;, or sorry, BestARG even about?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: It's avant-garde, didn't you hear? You sound like the critics right now. It's not <span class="italic">about</span> anything. It doesn't <span class="italic">mean</span> anything. But it is everything. The best everything, in fact.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood [confusedly]</span>: I'm not sure I quite follow.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: Really? Makes sense. Wouldn't expect that much from, you know, an ICaRE researcher. You guys really believe in magic?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood [sarcastically]</span>: Yeah. If that magic explains your symptoms, then it's what we believe in.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Guard</span>: Please follow standard procedure. Move on.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: Figured. Moving back to my BestARG. You have any questions?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Why is it so "special" like you mentioned?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: It's simply revolutionary. There's nothing like it. I dare you to find me one more ARG with <span class="italic">this</span> many specially made and intricate pages. I dare you to find one, just <span class="italic">one</span>, more ARG with such mind-numbingly hard puzzles.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: ...And you believe twenty "coming soon" pages, with a few containing HTML comments as both "revolutionary" and "mind-numbingly hard puzzles"?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: You don't see it. The true meaning. The code comments are hidden in the most intricate ways possible. Only my true followers could find the true webpages. Of obscurity.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Sorry, I stand corrected. I believe you use ROT13 for encoding your messages. Oh, I apologize, you also did use a few console.log functions in order to <span class="italic">print</span> such encrypted messages to the console. Very hidden, right?</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(NT chuckles. Alone.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: Now you're getting it! This is why I am Besttuber. And you're a researcher. See?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: I do. Could you please elaborate on the puzzles?</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: Handcrafted. Designed to be mind-numbing. They should crosslink to each other. That's what ARGs are supposed to do. Especially BestARG. One of them, the QR code links to my 404 webpage and is a red herring.</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(NT briefly pauses.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: And one, is encoded via a series of alphabetical transitions, increasing and offseting lexical symbol order by a predefined integer. That's an avant-garde cipher if I've ever seen one. Don't worry though, I already know everything, Doc. Specifically, the predefined number is thirteen. It's what I call an avant-garde number. Free of unoriginality. Perfect for avant-garde, revolutionary, and modernistic ARGs, especially the best of all time, past, present, future, named by the general public as BestARG created by the one and <span class="italic">only</span> Besttuber, Bestcoder and BestARGMaker.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: To confirm, the "avant-garde cipher" is ROT13?</p>
                    <p class="italic center">(NT smirks.)</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: You say as if it's a bad thing, Doc.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood [mockingly]</span>: Just saying, Julius Caesar would be porud.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">NT</span>: He wouldn't be. Caesar didn't invent it. I did. In spirit. Also, time's up, genius.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood</span>: Thank you.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">FOREWORD</span>: This interview was conducted on ██/██/202█ 03:07,. It was conducted at a non-standard time due to NT forcibly requesting interviews, demanding to "talk about his ARG". It is also possible that NT could've been suffering from FCE-induced dyschronometria. It is presumed by the extraneous footage at the beginning of the video log that NT started that video recorder himself. This is unexpected of FCE patients due to their inability for un-LFU-related thoughts.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Dr. Wood [sarcastically]</span>: Obviously not. It's not like you used a two thousand year old cipher that you "invented yourself in spirit", right?</p>
