                <p><span class="bold">SUMMARY</span>: This document attempts to analyse NTARG's splash texts. The splash texts are stored in a JSON file. These splash texts are presumed to simulate humor or "quirkiness", an attribute which NT believes to denote personality. Note that all typography and grammar mistakes were preserved. Also note that all splash text appears to be incoherent when compared to the rest of NTARG documentation, thus increasing the CDS.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">SPLASH TEXT LIST</span>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subspace Tripmine: meaning unknown. Likely in an attempt to sound esoteric.</li>
                    <li>Hello, World!: likely attempt at boast programming skills, adjacent to FCE Stage 5 illness superiority complex.</li>
                    <li>h, hru? i m a (n)xpd programr!: meaning likely "hello, how are you? I'm a (n)xpd(?) programmer!". Note (n)xpd's meaninglessness, likely code word for LFU-positive content creator.</li>
                    <li>insane Robloxian with mental issues is here!: NT is allowed at most 5 hours of external platform entertainment, however he usually denies to continue consumption of LFU-positive content. "mental issues" likely referring to Stage 5 FCE.</li>
                    <li>"I Am ‚ñà‚ñà, the Being of Insanity, Hatred and Negativity" - ‚ñà‚ñà, 2025: attempt to simulate "quirkiness" or "edginess" via the use of non-uniform capitalization of initial characters, and overall use of "negative" words such as Insanity or Hatred. Redacted phrase is NT's online internet persona.</li>
                    <li>i eat dihydrogen monoxide: dihydrogen monoxide is water, named such for a hoax. Splash text is also an attempt at "quirkiness" and "edginess".</li>
                    <li>got some pizza?: attempt at "quirkiness".</li>
                    <li>car üöó: splash text shows extreme mental and linguistic degradation caused by FCE and cohesion to UI-style linguistic traits.</li>
                    <li>yes, im insane: attempt at "edginess". Insanity described may be caused by FCE, however, subjects usually are not aware of this.</li>
                    <li>unlike normal gamers, i touch grass.: attempt at "quirkiness". NT appears to pride himself in basic primal behavior.</li>
                    <li>i bring knives to school every day: attempt at "edginess". Based on interviews done by classmates of NT prior to his hospitalization, the knives mentioned were in fact not knives, but was actually the sharp end of compass used to construct circles.</li>
                    <li>WE ARE FORSAKEN üó£Ô∏èüî•üíØ: linguistic regression towards UI-type emojis and empty semantic units.</li>
                    <li>tre üå≥: similar to attempted reconstructions of early human speak, also note the regression towards three-character linguistic units and emojis.</li>
                    <li>theres a chance youll get a hint when refreshing the page!: breaks the imaginary "fourth wall", increasing CDS significantly.</li>
                    <li>leave this page open and do absolutely nothing for 5 minutes for a surprise!: the "surprise" mentioned is a minimal-effort recreation of the DVD logo screensaver.</li>
                    <li>since 2025!: NT prides himself for self-acclaimed "originality". When asked about NTARG, he claimed that it was "completely original" and "never seen before" despite matching former Brainrot Group code semantics.</li>
                    <li>9 + 10 = 21: attempt to simulate humor via previous "memes", possibly reinforcing the Recursive Identity Theorem detailed at <a href="../../iz-002/2/index.html">IZ-002.2</a>.</li>
                    <li>i honestly dont know what im doing: statement is true. Attempts to simulate "quirkiness" via self-loathing.</li>
                    <li>-200% bug free!: attempts to simulate "quirkiness" via self-loathing due to inabillity to pre-test code caused by FCE disease.</li>
                    <li>made by ‚ñà‚ñà!: claiming originality. Redacted phrase is NT's online internet persona.</li>
                    <li>Rule #4: it's never my fault: attempt to dodge all responsibility, adjacent to Stage 5 FCE superiority complex.</li>
                    <li>I need more context.: attempt to simulate "edginess".</li>
                    <li>Home-made!: attempt to claim originality. Statement is opposed to corporate-made, which better fits XT motives.</li>
                    <li>I'm glad you're here!: NT may enjoy the torturing of others via propagation of LFU-positive content, however, FCE subjects usually do not know about their cognitive degradation.</li>
                    <li>So. You read splash texts.: NT attempts to berate the viewer for reading LFU-positive splash texts.</li>
                    <li>Change my mind.: likely in reference to Stage 5 LFU, however subjects usually do not know about their cognitive regression.</li>
                    <li>Made with HTML5!: likely attempt at boast programming skills, adjacent to FCE Stage 5 illness superiority complex.</li>
                    <li>no.: attempt to simulate "edginess".</li>
                    <li>as a Taph main i yearned for the tripmines: meaning unknown. Likely in an attempt to sound esoteric and "edgy".</li>
                    <li>‚ñà‚ñà IS ME: NT appears to mimic early hominids via incorrect semantic structure and linguistic units. Redacted phrase is NT's online internet persona.</li>
                    <li>[ERROR: "Text not found"]: attempt to simulate "edginess".</li>
                    <li>[this splash text is no longer available]: attempt to simulate "edginess".</li>
                    <li>i usually procrastinate updates, sorry: attempt to appear apologetic, however this is only a mere facade as FCE Stage 5 patients do not and can not feel empathetic towards others.</li>
                    <li>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!: attempt to simulate "quirkiness".</li>
                    <li>if not ok then return end: likely attempt at boast programming skills, adjacent to FCE Stage 5 illness superiority complex.</li>
                    <li>There's &lt;&lt;a cat on ,my keyboard!~: attempt to disturb the viewer via aversive-inducing feelings by the use of the tilde character.</li>
                    <li>you should join my <a href="//discord.gg/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà" target="_blank">Discord server</a> now!: Discord server link redacted due to containing FCE patients.</li>
                    <li>ü•ö ‚Üê This is my chicken Paul. He hasn't hatched yet. Please put him in your <a href="//neal.fun/password-game" target="_blank">password</a> and keep him safe: another clear indicator of FCE disease, Neal.fun games were the main subjects of UI's and other LFU-positive content creators' content.</li>
                    <li><a href="//roblox.fandom.com/wiki/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà_‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà" target="_blank">‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà!</a>: content redacted for containing significant amounts of LFU. The link is to the Roblox fandom page about a "humorous" linguistic phrase.</li>
                    <li>[<a href="//‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà" target="_blank">camel-eating-a-cactus.gif</a>]: attempt of both "edginess" via randomized humorous units and boasting of programming skills via cryptic naming conventions. Link redacted for containing LFU-positive content.</li>
                    <li><a href="//youtu.be/YQZEoZ4W0ac" target="_blank" id="splash-link">Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday</a>. And right now you can save &pound;50 per person! That&apos;s &pound;200 off for a family of 4.: attempts to simulate humor.</li>
                    <li>also try <a href="//‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà" target="_blank" id="splash-link">‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà</a>!: link and name redacted for containing extremely LFU-positive content. Content mentioned is likely a front for UI and XT-based activities on the entertainment platform Roblox.</li>
                    <li>S-762 and S-565 are my friends: both names are internal NTARG references. The use of the word "friends" completely undermines the cryptic design of NTARG, increasing NTARG's CDS.</li>
