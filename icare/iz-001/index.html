                <p>UI is a content creator and anomaly being studied at ICaRE on the video-sharing platform YouTube, under the handle @UltraInterface679. The following is its biography. Some details about the biography (specifically, channel names and sensitive links) have been redacted. Also assume that all typography and grammar mistakes were taken directly from Ultra Interface's writing.</p>

                <p class="center italics">A screenshot of Ultra Interface's YouTube channel on July 25th, 2025. As of right now, UI's subscriber count statistic appears stagnant, however video uploads appear to continue. Note the obviously artificial intelligence generated profile picture and banner.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Based on forensic analysis (and the sheer overuse of emojis) done by ICaRE, it is likely that the biography was created using artificial intelligence services (most plausibly ChatGPT) then edited after by UI itself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>UI's YouTube channel was created on October 12th, 2021, however, its first known video upload was on February 5th, 2024. A hypothesis is that UI's YouTube channel was previously owned by a human being for leisure and entertainment, which after the upload date of its first video had transferred the channel's ownership to an anomalous entity, further referred to as xUI. xUI will be further documented in <a href="../iz-002/index.html" target="_blank">IZ-002</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>UI's videos consists of low-fidelity screen recordings of <a href="https://www.neal.fun" target="_blank">Neal.fun</a> games, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas footage, often involving some self-assigned challenge or task like exploring an in-game structure, a multitude of Microsoft Flight Simulator videos with captions regarding plane landings as "clean" or "smooth", heavily artificial intelligence-assisted videos, and content similar to rivals detailed in the biography section.</p>
                <br>
                <p>UI's content often includes background music sourced from No Copyright Songs, to such a degree that its entire channel revolves around electronic to corporate adjacent emotionless tracks and videos. This in turn affects viewer's emotion and reaction to its videos as "empty" and "filler". It is suspected that this behavior is anomalous. <span class="text-hidden">The passcode in order to progress to L1 is 7930. Find where to type it.</span></p>
