                <p><span class="bold">SUMMARY</span>: On â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/2025 (before NT's relocation into ICaRE FCE Medical Ward 1), the channel "The 7 Interface" uploaded a video titled "EXPOLRATION[sic] IN ABANDONED BULDING[sic]????!?!?!?!?!? (SCARY) ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°". This video was flagged by automatic ICaRE tracking systems as containing possible geodata of his location. Due to the video possibly containing sensitive data about anomalies being studied by the ICaRE, the video was subsequently taken down via theoretical anti-video formulation: the creation of an "anti-video", reacting with the original video in order to destroy it, similar to how negatively and positively charged particles destroy each other. The video is a low quality real life video of a person exploring an abandoned building, constantly zooming into patches of drywall and repeated uses of phrases similar to "OH MY GOD GUYS?! I THINK I SEE SOMETHING". The location is unknown, however you have been tasked to find it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Attached is the thumbnail to that video. Note the overuse of Impact in red text with overly exaggerated phrases.</p>
