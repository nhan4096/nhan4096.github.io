                <p>This document details NT, a patient affected with Stage 5 FCE. He is currently being held at ICaRE FCE Medical Ward 1, constantly facing upwards to a large 75-inch TV, where he is monitored for signs of recovery, although none have been found. It seems his disease is stable, with no further updates since passing the threshold for Stage 5 FCE, on August 5th, 2024.</p>
                <br>
                <p>He is allowed to upload at most 5 videos to his channel, named "The 7 Interface" (@InterfaceSeven). Personnel dealing with him are expected to ignore his constant vocalizations and murmurs stating that he "is the besttuber" or his promotions to LFU-positive content creators. For this, earmuffs are required when entering his containment room.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The following is a timeline of NT's slow degradation, lasting exactly 47 days.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[19/06/2024] NT accidentally clicks on one of UI's videos ("SPONGEBOB The Dark Truth You Never Knew Existed!", pictured below), via algorithmic recommendation, marking the onset of Stage 1 FCE. Initial behavioral response indicated aversion to such content, yet continued watching. Current total LFU exposure score is at 4.3.</li>
                    <div class="center-flex">
                        <img src="/icare/media/spongebob.png" alt="SpongeBob video thumbnail">
                        <p class="italics">"SPONGEBOB The Dark Truth You Never Knew Existed!"'s thumbnail, created by Ultra Interface. Approximate LFU: 4.3, much higher than average, due to the TTS voice, and clickbait-type content.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li>[20/06/2024] NT watches the entirety of the "Reaction Loop" video series; however, only watching UI's reactions, stating that "the other creators weren't interesting enough". It is likely that there is some preference towards LFU-positive content during Stage 1. Approximate total LFU of the "Reaction Loop" series is 5.4. NT is 0.3 LFU away from approximate onset of Stage 2. Current total LFU exposure score is at 9.7.</li>
                    <li>[21/06/2024] At 13:30 on this date, ICaRE systems were notified of a new upload on UI's channel. Standard post-upload checks were performed, including an LFU measurement test. Video titled "Trying to not die, but still dies.(Hijacking)" (pictured below), measured 9.5 LFU, extremely high due to the presence of auditory oversaturation and excessively loud background music (Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd), a low quality recording of the game GTA: San Andreas and overall edginess due to the theme of the video being "hijacking". NT immediately watched this video within 5 seconds, advancing into Stage 2. Current total LFU exposure score is at 19.2.</li>
                    <div class="center-flex">
                        <img src="/icare/media/hijack.png" alt="Hijacking video thumbnail">
                        <p class="italics">"Trying to not die, but still dies.(Hijacking)"'s thumbnail, created by Ultra Interface.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li>[22/06/2024 &mdash; 22/07/2024] Time period skipped for brevity, NT continued to watch UI videos. Notably, NT replayed Ultra Interface's GTA: San Andreas-related videos, taking interest in the game. Current total LFU exposure score at end of timestamp is at 167.3, 7.7 LFU from Stage 3's threshold.</li>
                    <li>[23/07/2024] NT continues to watch GTA: San Andreas videos, possibly indicating variants of the disease where persons affected begin to watch content only related to niche interests, such as GTA: San Andreas or Neal.fun videos. Current total LFU exposure score is at 175.0, Stage 3's onset.</li>
                    <li>[24/07/2024] NT expresses aversion towards OBS website, quoting that he was aiming for a "minimalist approach", instead opting to use Bandicam (unregistered). Channel "The 7 Interface" created, under handle @InterfaceZero. First video uploaded: "GTA SAN IS SO CRAZY AT 3AM??!!??!?! ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²", following video structure similar to that of UI: exaggerated title, emoji spam and self-assigned challenges with no conclusion. LFU score of this video is 3.3. Current total LFU exposure score is at 181.6, due to NT rewatching his video twice declaring that he was "the Besttuber".</li>
                    <li>[25/07/2024 &mdash; 02/08/2024] NT does not sleep during this time period, instead, choosing to watch LFU-positive videos, usually GTA: San Andreas footage. The complete absence of sleep is considered anomalous. This symptom was previously not known for Stage 3+ FCE. Addition to symptom list is pending. Current total LFU exposure score at the end of this timestamp is at 527.7, 27.7 points above the threshold for Stage 4 FCE.</li>
                    <li>[03/08/2024 &mdash; 05/08/2024] NT is described by peers at school as "insufferable", likely due to the superiority complex adopted by subjects at this stage of Stage 4 FCE. NT can no longer focus on standardized education, requiring large red buttons labeled "Subscribe" to understand such lessons. NT reaches Stage 5 FCE at the end of timestamp, thus being completely incapable of creative thinking or critical thought. Current total LFU exposure score at the end of this timestamp is at 1301.1 (due to NT using multiple devices at once, all to watch such content), much higher than Stage 5's onset of 1250 LFU.</li>
