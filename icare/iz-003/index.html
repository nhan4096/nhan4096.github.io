                <p>The Feedback Contagion Effect is a type of five-staged memetic disease caused by excessive exposure to content created by Ultra Interface, ending with complete collapse of creative thinking, critical thought, and inversion of preference. </p>
                <br>
                <p>An LFU (Low Fidelity Unit) is a measurement of the total "effect" inflicted on from content produced by UI and persons affected with CTCTT affected past Stage 3, i.e. the lower the video quality, the higher the LFU measure. For example, the average LFU measure of UI content is around 1.2. Note that LFU can only measure content produced by UI. The LFU completely fails when attempting to measure other content creators with approximately the same "inadequacy" video quality, instead, measuring such content's LFU as negative. This could possibly imply that UI's "bad" content's nature is anomalous and different from ordinary "bad"ness, thus being able to be measured by the LFU scale. LFU is calculated by an undisclosed function involving bitrate, video resolution, choice of background music, loudness, the number of sudden jumpcuts or untrimmed silences per minute and the Vocal Cohesion Score.</p>

                <p>The CTCTT (Creative Thinking&mdash;Critical Thought test) is a test which grades the examinee at two measures affected by FCE, namely creative thinking and critical thought. The human baseline CTCTT score is at 30/30.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Attached below is the five stages of FCE, detailed by researcher L.C.K.:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Stage 1 (The Onset)</span>. Onset: 1 LFU. Average CTCTT score 29/30 during this stage, slightly lower than baseline human score. Subject usually states "not getting the appeal [of Ultra Interface content]". In spite of this, subject continues watching Ultra Interface videos. During this, subject experiences euphoric feelings, similar to those when exposed to content created by channel with younger audiences, especially MÃ¨o Simmy. Subjects at this stage may begin repeating Xitray Team quotes publically out of context, especially "who cares?" and "min &lt; max is nearly impossible", indicating small cognitive-linguistic deterioration.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Stage 2 (The Denial)</span>. Onset: 10 LFU. Average CTCTT score 25/30, lower than baseline human score. Subject denies enjoying UI content, yet experiences even more heightened rapturous emotions. It is around this stage that FCE is considered uncurable. Prognosis beyond this stage is gradual decline of mental stability and continued progression towards full mental collapse.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Stage 3 (The Imitation)</span>. Onset: 175 LFU. Average CTCTT score drops even further to 19/30, signaling cognitive dysfunction. As content produced by UI is not enough to reach the threshold for Stage 3, subject will either rewatch UI content or watch other positive-LFU content produced by other persons affected by FCE past stage 3. Around this stage, influenced persons begin producing positive-LFU content of their own, under some variation of "Ultra Interface", such as "Interface Ultimate". Content includes poorly-chosen background music overpowering elements of the video, screen recordings of topics that UI frequently upload about, and similar VCS (Vocal Cohesion Score) to that of UI.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Stage 4 (The Assimilation)</span>. Onset: 500 LFU. Average CTCTT is 9/30, significantly below the minimum CTCTT score considered possible for humans of 15, showing complete societal dysfunction. Subject begins to openly enjoy positive-LFU content, while also unpromptedly recommending such content to others. It is suspected that this behavior is a secondary propagation method for positive-LFU content, with the primary one being through YouTube "For You" feed recommendations. At this point, if the subject is not shown positive-LFU content for more than 5 minutes, they begin to experience withdrawal with extreme aggression and meaningless threats such as pointing imaginary guns through electrical devices to "coerce" personnel to show such content. Personnel tasked with dealing FCE patients are recommended to oblige. Subject also begins to completely abandon their previous identity, instead adopting a derivative name based on "Ultra Interface". They also adopt a superiority complex, praising positive-LFU and especially their own content as being "the best" and calling themselves "the Besttuber".</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Stage 5 (The Collapse)</span>. Onset: 1250 LFU. Average CTTT is 0/30, indicating complete cognitive collapse. Subject is no longer capable of any creative thinking nor critical thought, instead blindly following UI-based extremes for preferences, for example, openly disliking media often percieved positively while experiencing extremely frantic happinness when watching positive-LFU content. At this point, subject is considered to be in a vegetable-like state, being able to control muscles yet choosing not to, deciding to be in a sedentary position in order to watch previously described content.</li>
