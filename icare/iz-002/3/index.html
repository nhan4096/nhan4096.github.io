                <p><span class="bold">HYPOTHESIS</span>: The Ultra Interface channel is owned by an anti-personality, most likely a human being, theoretically appealing to no one, yet attracting viewership anomalously.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">EVIDENCE</span>: From IZ-002.2's counter-arguments: "Starting on July 11th, 2025, Ultra Interface started a video series called a "reaction loop". A reaction loop is a content loop initiated by two channels, with one channel reacting to the other channel's previous video. This in turn also reveals Ultra Interface's voice, described by many to be "unintelligible". Ultra Interface's voice's Vocal Cohesion Score, ranked from 0 (mutually indistinguishable to ancient caveman vocalizations) to 7 (clear), scored a 1.2.". IZ-002.2's hypothesis and this hypothesis are mutual opposites, meaning that if one were true, the other must not be true, but if one were false, it does not imply that the other one is true.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ultra Interface's content have also shown a extreme lack of quality in editing, footage choice and recording fidelity. Whether or not this is directly related to xUI being an anti-personality is unknown. It is equally plausible that UI might also be bereft of proper skill required to create low-fidelity videos, let alone competent content creation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Based on Video To Views simulations (approximating the amount of viewership that a video will get based on its merits) done by ICaRE analysts, all videos of the UI channel were estimated to have a view count of around 30 &plusmn 20 viewers. Despite this, a majority of UI's shorts reach counts from 200 and up to 2000 views in some cases, substantially more than estimates.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">COUNTER-EVIDENCE</span>: In spite of the VTV analysis done, multiple researchers have also proposed that Ultra Interface bought views via platforms such as Views4You, in spite of YouTube's Terms of Service. This is further supported by the extreme count of likes, reaching to implausible ratios, likely bought together with the views. There is also a lack of comments, averaging around 0.1 comments per 100 views, as bots do not and can not create meaningful comments. Updates to VTV simulations in order to include bot views based on prior metrics pending.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">CONSEQUENCES</span>: If this hypothesis were to be true, it would suggest that a theoretical anti-personality does in fact exist, and the human subconscious may be manipulated at all times via a process tentatively named "overloading": invoking extreme disgust and aversive reactions, to which humans respond with positive emotions.</p>
