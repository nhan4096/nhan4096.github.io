                <p><span class="bold">HYPOTHESIS</span>: The Ultra Interface channel is owned by a recursive identity generator, creating its personality from an aggregate of multiple years of Internet culture and trends.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">EVIDENCE</span>: Most videos on UI's channel can be split into multiple categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas footage;</li>
                    <li>Various "humorous" memes;</li>
                    <li>Footage of or created by <a href="https://www.neal.fun" target="_blank">Neal.fun</a>, usually older videos;</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Flight Simulator footage of "smooth" plane landings.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Note the relevancy of all four topics to common Internet culture, especially the second topic. Games such as GTA: San Andreas, Microsoft Flight Simulator or Neal.fun are also known to be popular within "edgy" Internet subcultures.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ultra Interface's content is often a mix of memes and video game footage. This is a common trait of many Internet personalities, especially those who are popular among younger audiences, possibly supporting the recursive identity generator hypothesis.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">COUNTER-EVIDENCE</span>: Starting on July 11th, 2025, Ultra Interface started a video series called a "reaction loop". A reaction loop is a content loop initiated by two channels, with one channel reacting to the other channel's previous video. This in turn also reveals Ultra Interface's voice, described by many to be "unintelligible". Ultra Interface's voice's Vocal Cohesion Score, ranked from 0 (mutually indistinguishable to ancient caveman vocalizations) to 7 (clear), scored a 1.2. Due to the unfavorability of vocalizations, this opposes the hypothesis.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">CONSEQUENCES</span>: If this hypothesis were to be true, it is presumed that Ultra Interface's identity sources were possibly from more content creators aiming towards younger audiences. ICaRE analysts have flagged a surprising similarity between Ultra Interface and MÃ¨o Simmy, a Vietnamese content creator usually playing games with lower aged audiences such as Minecraft or Roblox. Notably, both display title capitalization patterns followed by either interrobangs (?!), multiple exclamation marks or question marks and then related emojis, e.g. SMOOTH BUTTER PLANE LANDING!!!!ðŸ§ˆðŸ§ˆðŸ§ˆ. Another similarity is the use of fast-paced humor cycles (reference, laugh and react) average at around 3.5 for both channels.</p>
