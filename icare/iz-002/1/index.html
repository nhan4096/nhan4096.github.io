                <p><span class="bold">HYPOTHESIS</span>: The Ultra Interface channel is owned by an artificial intelligence construct, designed to produce detached videos described as "funny" or "relatable".</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">EVIDENCE</span>: About five months ago, on January 19th, 2025 and January 23rd, 2025, the Ultra Interface channel uploaded two videos using the artificial intelligence-based platform Storyblocks in order to produce videos. The two videos are titled "Why GTA Games Are The Most Addictive Games Ever" and "CRISTIANO RONALDO Takes On LIONEL MESSI in EPIC 1v1 Showdown". The former's description reads "Just testing out this app!". It is presumed that if this hypothesis were to be true, these two videos were an accidental momentary lapse in content creation revealing what xUI truly was.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, on August 9th, 2025 and August 11th, 2025, the Ultra Interface channel uploaded two videos that were recordings of the game Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their titles were, respectively, "Smooth butter landing A320!🧈🛬" and "Smooth butter landing F-15E!🧈😎✈️ #aviation #fighterjet #landing #smoothasbutter 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 ". The latter's description is "🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈 F-15E 🛬 Smooth landing like a boss! 😎✈️ #aviation #fighterjet #landing #smoothasbutter 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈". Based on the sheer overuse of emojis and hashtags in the second title, it seems that this video was also created by the artificial intelligence construct. Also included was the poor choice of background music, namely electronic and emotionless No Copyright Songs' tracks, sounding similar to corporate music.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="bold">COUNTER-EVIDENCE</span>: Multiple "real-life" videos were uploaded onto the Ultra Interface channel, for example, the poorly edited "I nearly die[sic] filming this video!!!😱💀" attached below. Multiple other now-deleted videos were also made, including videos showing UI's alleged face and voice. One example was UI's "face reveal at X likes", stating in the video that he was "shy" and "please don't hurt me". </p>

                <p><span class="bold">CONSEQUENCES</span>: If this theory were to be true, xUI would be another artificial intelligence construct developed by the Xitray Team. xUI could also be T6.ai, although this theory appears to be false due to it defecting to Brainrot Group.</p>
